The lion and the rabbit
A cruel lion lived in the forest. Every day, he killed and ate a lot of animals. The other animals were afraid the lion would kill them all.
The animals told the lion, �Let�s make a deal. If you promise to eat only one animal each day, then one of us will come to you every day. Then you don�t have to hunt and kill us.�
The plan sounded well thought-out to the lion, so he agreed, but he also said, �If you don�t come every day, I promise to kill all of you the next day!�
Each day after that, one animal went to the lion so that the lion could eat it. Then, all the other animals were safe.
Finally, it was the rabbit�s turn to go to the lion. The rabbit went very slowly that day, so the lion was angry when the rabbit finally arrived.
The lion angrily asked the rabbit, �Why are you late?�
�I was hiding from another lion in the forest. That lion said he was the king, so I was afraid.�
The lion told the rabbit, �I am the only king here! Take me to that other lion, and I will kill him."
The rabbit replied, �I will be happy to show you where he lives.�
The rabbit led the lion to an old well in the middle of the forest. The well was very deep with water at the bottom. The rabbit told the lion, �Look in there. The lion lives at the bottom.�
When the lion looked in the well, he could see his own face in-the water. He thought that was the other lion. Without waiting another moment, the lion jumped into the well to attack the other lion. He never came out.
All of the other animal in the forest were very pleased with the rabbit�s clever trick.

1 One night, Mia approached the door to the laboratory. She stopped and thought, �I wonder what crazy experiment he is doing now.� Suddenly, she heard a loud noise. It sounded like an evil laugh. The noise scared her, so she walked quickly back to her room.
The next night, her friend Liz came to her house. When Liz arrived, Mia told her about the night before. �Oh, it was terrible,� she said.
�Why don�t we see what is in there?� Liz asked. �It will be a fun adventure!� Mia felt nervous about going into her father�s laboratory, but she agreed. As always, the door was locked. They waited until Mia�s father left the laboratory to eat dinner. �He didn�t lock the door!� Liz said. �Let�s go.�
The laboratory was dark. The girls walked down the stairs carefully. Mia smelled strange chemicals. What terrible thing was her father creating?
Suddenly, they heard an evil laugh. It was even worse than the one Mia heard the night before. What if a monster was going to kill them? Mia had to do something. She shouted for help.
Mia�s father ran into the room and turned on the lights. �Oh, no,� he said. �You must have learned my secret.� �Your monster tried to kill us,� Mia said.
�Monster?� he asked. �You mean this?� He had a pretty doll in his hands. The doll laughed. The laugh didn�t sound so evil anymore. �I made this for your birthday. I wanted to give it to you then, but you can have it now. I hope you like it !"

The Report
Lee sat among the books at the library and thought about his group project.
They had to turn it in soon, but he hadn�t even started his part! Jack and Claire were in his group. They had worked hard. They were also very smart, and Lee didn�t want them to get a bad grade.
Jack did the report. He wrote a lot of very good sentences and described things with great adjectives. Claire drew a nice map of the stars. Now, Lee needed to do his part of the project.
�Well, I suppose I need to start my model,� Lee thought.
Making a model of a planet was really hard. Lee tried to read several books, but he couldn�t comprehend any of the charts. �We�re going to fail because of me!� Lee said. He put his head down on the table and said, �I wish I could see a planet, instead of having to read about it!�
Suddenly, there was a bright light. Lee was pulled from his chair, through the roof, and right into a strange ship! �Hello, kid,� said an alien. �Did you ask for help?�
Lee told the friendly alien all about his project. The alien agreed to help Lee solve his problem. �First, we�ll fly through space to view the universe. Then, I can help you make a model of my planet.�
Soon, they were going through the clouds. They passed the moon. Then they viewed Mars. Lee was very excited. Instead of a bad grade, his group would have the best project ever!
�It�s time to go home,� the alien finally said. On the way back, he helped Lee make a model of the planet Mars. Soon, they were on Earth.
�Thanks,� Lee said. �My model will be awesome!� Then he took his model and said goodbye to his new friend.

The Dog�s Bell
John�s dog was a bad dog. He bit people frequently. John had great concern about this. It was not an appropriate way for a dog to behave. His friends in the village always expected the dog to bite them. The news about John�s dog spread through the village. None of the people wanted to go to John�s house. John tried to instruct the dog to behave, but it never worked. He tried to be patient and teach the dog to be calm. That also didn�t work. John didn�t want to punish the dog. �How will I stop my dog�s bad habit?� John asked himself.
John�s friend came to talk to him about the issue. During their important meeting, his friend said, �The people in the village asked me to represent them. We want your dog to stop this habit. Why don�t you put a bell around the dog�s neck? This way, we would hear your dog coming down the street.�
John thought this was a great idea. Now, people could stay away from the dog. It would not be able to bite anyone anymore.
The dog liked the bell, too. People looked at him when they heard his bell. This made the dog very content. He liked the song the bell played when he walked.
One day, John�s dog strolled through the village and met some other dogs. He expected them to want a bell like his. But they laughed at his bell. They said the bell made people avoid him. John�s dog shook his head. �No, they look at me because they like the bell.�
The other dogs said, �You have the wrong idea of what makes you popular. Of course they like your bell. It tells them where you are so they can avoid you. You aren�t able to bite them anymore!�
You see, being popular isn�t something positive when it�s for the wrong reason.

The Jackal and the Sun Child
A jackal is a wild dog with a big black back. It resides in the desert. But how did the jackal get his black back? This was how it happened.
One day, the jackal saw a girl. She was sitting upon a rock. She was not a normal child. She was a rare and beautiful sun child. She was bright and warm like the sun. The child saw the jackal and smiled.
She said, �Jackal, I have been relaxing on this rock for too long. I must get home soon. But, I am slow and you are fast. You will likely get me home more quickly.� Then she requested, �Will you carry me home? If you do, I�ll give you a gift. This necklace belongs to me, but I will give it to you.�
The wild jackal agreed. So the sun child sat on the dog�s back. They started to walk. But soon, the jackal felt ill. The sun child was very hot on his back. The heat was hurting his back very badly. �I made a terrible error in judgment.� he thought. He shouldn�t have agreed to carry her. So he asked her to get off.
But she did not. The jackal�s back continued to get hotter and hotter. He had to get away from the sun child. So he made a plan. First, he ran as fast as he could. He hoped the sun child would fall off. But she did not. So when the sun child was looking at the sky, not aware of the jackal�s next plan, he jumped into a field of flowers. As a result, the child rolled off his back. The jackal ran away.
But the sun child left a mark on the jackal�s back, a visible black mark. Ever since his experience with the sun child, the jackal has had a black back.

The Best Prince
King Minos was very sick. His condition was getting worse. He had three sons. He loved them all. He had to announce who would become king.
Two of the princes stood waiting outside the king�s room. Theseus was the oldest and strongest. He thought his father would make him king. Pelias, the second son, thought differently. He was an expert with weapons. He thought the king would choose him.
�When I�m king,� Theseus told Pelias, �I�ll let you contribute to the defense of our country. You can lead the army.�
Pelias became angry. �Father knows I�m famous for my sword skills. He�ll make me king.�
�You?� Theseus yelled. �He won�t choose you!�
�The kingdom is mine!� Pelias claimed. �Father will give it to me�or I�ll use force to take it!�
Theseus made a sudden move to take out his sword. Then Pelias did the same.
�Beating me will be a challenge,� Theseus said. �Fight me now. The winner gets the kingdom!�
Pelias agreed.
King Minos could hear his sons fighting. The youngest son, Jason, stood beside him. He sensed his father�s sadness. The king laid his hand flat on Jason�s arm.
�Your brothers fight too much,� the king told him. �I must protect my kingdom from all harm. They�ll divide it between them. The people won�t know what to do. There�ll be war. I can�t allow either of them to be king. Therefore, I�m making you king. Your kindness has always made you special. It�s the difference between you and your brothers. You can bring peace. They can�t.�
Then the king died. Theseus and Pelias heard that their youngest brother was king. They were surprised. They realized that their fighting was wrong. It had kept them from saying goodbye to their father. They agreed to have Jason as their king. He was the best choice.

How the Sun and the Moon Were Made
Do you ever wonder where the moon and the sun came from? The Inuit people of Alaska have a theory.
They tell a story about a beautiful girl. She was very nice. In contrast, her brother was a mean little boy. One day he proposed something. �We should go to a party,� he said. The girl accepted. First, it was necessary for her to prepare. She arranged her hair and put on nice clothes. This required a lot of time. But the girl worked hard, and soon she had success. She looked perfect.
They attended the party together. The girl was having fun. Later, she walked into the bathroom. Suddenly, the lights were turned off! Someone grabbed her hair and tore her clothes. She ran out of the bathroom. She wanted to know who did this to her.
Then she had an idea. She fixed her hair again. This time it was even more beautiful. She even balanced beautiful jewels in it. She wanted to encourage the person to grab it again. She put black dirt in her hair. The purpose of this was to catch the person.
She went to the bathroom again, and it was the same pattern. The lights went off, and someone grabbed her hair. When he released it, his hand was black. The girl returned to the party. She knew there was only a single person with a black hand. When she saw that person, he was very familiar. It was her brother!
He ran into the woods. The girl ran after him. They both carried fire so they could see in the dark. The smoke went into the air. As they ran, they grew. They became huge. Then they went into space. When the girl�s fire went out, she hung in the sky. She became the moon, and her brother became the sun. They chase each other forever.

The Starfish
Last summer I took a trip to an island. I had a lot of fun. I sat and watched the waves and listened to the ocean. I learned to identify birds. I discovered pretty things and enjoyed the taste of new foods. It was a very nice time.
One evening I took a pleasant walk by the ocean. When the waves came in, many starfish* fell on the beach. Some starfish went back into the water, and they were safe. But other starfish were still on the sand. They would die if they did not get into the water. There were many starfish on the beach that night. It made me sad, but I knew I could not fix the problem. I stepped very carefully so I did not damage them.
Then I saw a little girl. She was also sad about the starfish. She wanted to prevent all of them from dying. She asked me if I could perhaps help her.
�To be frank, I don�t think we can do anything,� I said.
The little girl started to cry. She sat back against a rock and thought for a while. Finally, the emotion was gone. She stopped crying and stood up. Then she picked up a starfish and threw it into the water.
�What are you doing?� I asked her. But she did not answer me. She just threw as many starfish as she could. �You cannot save all of them!� I said.
She stopped to look at me. �No, I cannot save them all,� she replied. Then she picked up a very big starfish and said, �But I can save this one.� And then she smiled and threw the starfish as far as she could into the ocean.

This news excited the dog. He felt fortunate that he happened to be there. �I don�t have anything to do today,� the dog said. �I want to buy a ticket, too.�
The dog sat down to observe the race. The race would be extreme. It would be many kilometers in length. The rabbit and the turtle stood next to each other. They waited for the race to start. The dog wondered why the turtle agreed to run against the rabbit. Being fast was not a characteristic of turtles. The rabbit was going to win easily.
Suddenly, the race began. The rabbit ran extremely quickly. The turtle walked slowly. After a minute, the rabbit looked back. He saw that the turtle was far behind him and was breathing quickly because he was so tired. The rabbit smiled and slowed to a walk.
A minute later, the rabbit said, �I�m winning, so I�ll take a rest.� He sat and began to consume some grass. Then, he let his eyes close. He wasn�t the winner yet. But there was no risk of him losing the race. He went to sleep.
Hours later, a loud sound woke him. All of the animals were yelling and looking at the field. He felt fear for the first time. The turtle was almost at the finish line. Now, the rabbit realized his mistake. But the race was over. He gave the turtle an opportunity to win, and the turtle took it. The duck handed the turtle his prize. It was the happiest day of the turtle�s life.

When the season changed from spring to summer, the clouds disappeared. The bright sun was hot and made the river dry. There was no water available. People asked, �When will the rain fall?�
The Sky�s response was, �You don�t appreciate water. You waste it, and now I will never make rain again.�
A boy determined that this wasn�t fair. He thought of a solution. He asked the Sky to race him. He said, �If I get to the top of that hill before your rain can form puddles, you must fill our river.�
The Sky laughed. �Little boy, I am the Sky. I am above everything else. You cannot beat me.� But the boy knew he would win.
When the race began, the boy ran forward. The Sky started raining on the hill. But puddles did not form there. When it rained on the hill, the water went down.
The Sky kept raining. The water flowed down into the river. When the boy reached the top of the hill, the river was full. The people began to celebrate. It was the highest level the river had ever been at before.
The Sky was angry. �A boy can�t beat me! I won�t fill your river,� it said. Now the boy laughed. �It doesn�t matter whether you want to fill it or not,� he said. �You already did.� The Sky looked at the full river.
�You tricked me,� it said. It asked the people, �Do you appreciate water now?�
�Yes,� they said. �We won�t waste it.�

The cat came and saw the bread on a dish.
�Give me some of your bread,� he said.
�No,� said the little red chicken. �You did not help me make the bread. So you shall not have any to eat.�
The cat argued with the chicken. He tried to offer a price for it. But the little red chicken did not want to sell her bread.
�Don�t depend on others to do work for you,� said the little red chicken.
�Then how will I get bread?� the cat asked.
�I recommend doing some work,� said the little red chicken. �Use a tool to plant your own wheat. When it grows big, you can gather it and make your own bread. You need to learn to do work for what you want.�

Coronado and his men rode for many days. Then they saw some cities. �We found the Seven Cities of Gold!� his men yelled, but Coronado wasn�t happy. He had a different opinion. �These can�t be the Seven Cities of Gold,� he said. �Look, they�re made of dirt!�
Coronado was right. The cities weren�t bright and golden. They were dirty and brown. The people didn�t eat meat from golden plates. They ate vegetables from regular bowls. They wore the most basic clothes.
Coronado regarded the cities as ugly places. �What happened to the cities of gold?� he thought. �Did someone destroy them? Was there a war? Did someone already come and take the gold?�
That night, the people of the cities entertained Coronado and his men and served them food. They advised Coronado to go home. �There is no gold here,� they told him. Coronado was angry. Did his friends lie to him?
He left the next morning. He looked back at s one more time. The sun reflected light dirt houses. Coronado thought he saw a bit of gold. Were his friends right after all? �No,� he told himself. �It�s just the sun.� Then he turned away and went home.

Katy
I first met 8-year-old Katy on a rainy afternoon. I was a nurse at a hospital. The clerk at the desk told me about Katy. She was there because she felt a lot of pain. The doctors located a problem at the base of her brain. I knew she was special, even before she got better. I�ll always remember Katy as a hero.
When I entered Katy�s room, she was not in her bed. She was in a chair next to Tommy, a little boy. Though Katy did not feel well, she was playing with Tommy and his toys. It took a lot of effort for her just to sit in the chair. But she played with Tommy because it made him happy.
Katy was always smiling and never appeared to be in pain. She refused to just lie in bed. One day I found her painting a picture. Later, she gave it to one of the older patients. Another day she went outside to get flowers for another sick little girl. Katy made everyone smile.
The doctors hurried to fix the problem in Katy�s brain. The operation was successful! The doctors informed the hospital staff of the good news. Katy was fine. She soon felt excellent. She got better and was able to leave the hospital a month later.
I have had a long career as a nurse. I have met many patients. However, I have never met another girl like Katy. Even after she got well, she still came to the hospital. She played various games with the young patients. She read many books to the older patients. Katy�s kind heart helped her get better so quickly. She is a hero to me and everyone else at the hospital.

A Better Reward
Jenny delivered food for a restaurant. She read the newspaper and said, �Uh oh.� There was a story about a thief. He stole food, and no one had seen him. Even the police couldn�t catch him. Jenny was a little scared. She worked close to that area.
The newspaper included a message from the police: �If anything strange occurs, call us. If you help us catch the thief, you�ll earn a reward.�
Jenny talked to Jim. He managed the restaurant. �Do you know about the thief?�
�Yes,� he said. �But he steals more than one person can eat. And why haven�t the police stopped him yet? It�s a mystery. If you see him, contact the police. Don�t run after him.�
Jenny drove to a customer�s house. She left her car and opened the gate to the house. But then she heard a noise by her car. She yelled, �Thief!� She wasn�t scared. She wanted the reward! She did the opposite of what Jim told her to do.
�Hey,� she yelled. �Get back here!� She set the food on the ground and ran to her car.
But the thief had already left with the food. Jenny followed a noise around the corner. She was amazed. She saw a dog and some puppies. They were eating her food! They looked thin and scared. �The actual thief is just a dog. She�s feeding her puppies,� she said. �That�s why she steals so much food.�
Jenny felt bad. She tried to comfort the dogs with another plate of food. Then she took them back to the store. Everyone there took a puppy home. Jenny called the police. She told them there was no real thief.
Jenny didn�t do it to receive the reward anymore. She said, �It was just a dog. But there�s no charge for catching this �thief,�� she said. �My new dog is a better reward.�

The people said, �This is a task for a strong man.� Tim was under pressure to save them. But Jack wanted to be the hero, so they both went. Tim said, �You can�t help because of your lack of strength.�
But Jack found some small passages under the snow. One of them led toward another town. That town had food. Because Tim was so big and strong, he almost couldn�t fit inside. They walked until there was a block of ice in their way. Jack said, �We can�t get past it. But if you strike it, it might break.� Tim knew that was probable.
He broke it. When there were more ice blocks, Tim broke them. That made him tired. He couldn�t walk anymore. Jack said, �Let�s unite and support each other. I�ll get the food alone. You rest here.�

Joe�s Pond
Joe made the world a better place. He got the idea to do that at school. He watched a video there. It was about a factory. This factory produced a lot of trash and put it in a river. The trash and water were a bad mix. People populated the area by the river and drank its water. This made them sick. Many of them needed medicine and made regular visits to doctors.
But the video wasn�t all bad news. It showed ways to pick up trash and why it�s important to do this. It said people can make a difference to their environment. The video�s important features made Joe associate trash with hurting people.
One day Joe walked through a park. He recognized some of the problems from the video. One instance of these problems was the trash in the pond. It was full of plastic cups. There was too much trash. Joe didn�t want it to hurt anyone.
He told his grandfather about the park. His grandfather said, �You know, it�s a tradition in our family to help people. That�s why we give food to poor people. Maybe you can help people by cleaning the park.�
Cleaning the park would involve hard work. Joe decided to organize a group to help him. He chose a wide area of the park. It had the most trash. He asked his family and friends to come. On Saturday, he gave everyone a sharp stick. They wondered why. He said, �You use the stick�s tip to pick up trash. This makes it easier.� They worked for six weeks. Different people helped each time, but Joe was always there.
In that period of time, Joe saw a range of results. There was no trash in the water. People could swim in it. Joe knew that was a good sign. He was happy because he helped his environment.

Old Archie needed some money. He decided to sell his donkey. So he and his son Tom went to town. It was situated many miles away.
Soon, they met a woman. �Where are you going?� she asked.
�To town,� said Archie.
�Any smart person would ride the donkey,� she said.
�What are you implying?� Archie asked. �I�m very smart!� Archie wanted to look smart. So he climbed onto the donkey. Then they continued in the direction of the town.
Further along the road, they met a farmer.
�Hello,� said Archie. �We want to sell this donkey. Do you want to buy it?�
�I don�t need a donkey,� said the farmer. �But if you want my advice, don�t ride it. The donkey needs to be in good physical condition.�
�Good idea,� said Archie. �Tom, I want you to ride it. You�re lighter.�
�Neither you nor your son should ride it. It looks very tired. You should carry the donkey.� suggested the farmer.
�You�re right,� said Archie. �Come on, Tom! We�ll carry it for the final few miles!�
The donkey was very heavy, and they couldn�t maintain a good speed. They didn�t arrive until late in the evening. At last, they walked into the town. But there they attracted the attention of some teenage boys. They laughed at Tom and Archie. They started to throw stones at them. The donkey reacted by kicking. Tom and Archie dropped the donkey. It fell on the ground and then ran away. Archie lost his donkey. He went home with no money.

The Spider and the Bird
There was once a very big spider. If a bug got into his web, he would examine it. However, he didn�t eat the bug right away. He asked the bug a question first. It was always quite a difficult puzzle. If the bug�s answer was correct, he let it go. If not, he ate it.
One day, a small bird on a journey flew into the spider�s web. The spider couldn�t imagine eating a bird. It was so big! But his hunger was too great. He said to the bird, �If you cannot give me a specific answer, I will eat you.�
The bird laughed. �I could eat you!� But the bird was actually scared. She had used all her energy trying to get out of the web. And a spider�s bite can be very effective in killing animals.
�Please don�t eat me,� the bird said. �I would rather make a deal with you.�
�OK,� the spider said. �If your answer is right, I will let you go. If not, you must give me a gift. It must be something of great value.�
The bird said, �You can pick anything you want to eat. I will find it for you.� The spider agreed.
�Where can you take a trip to the coast, the desert, and the mountains at the same time?� the spider asked.
The bird asked, �Does this place have earthquakes?� But the spider did not say anything. �I can see those places when I fly. Is the �sky� the right answer?�
�False!� said the spider. �The answer is Hawaii! Now you must find some bugs for me.�
The spider climbed on the bird�s back. They flew and ate bugs together. They took a tour of the forest. Then the bird took the spider home. From that day on, they were friends. And they never tried to eat each other again.

Cats and Secrets
In English, there is a common idiom �let the cat out of the bag.� It means to tell a secret. But where did this idiom start?
It came from a section of England. Long ago, people there went from town to town to sell things like vegetables, clothes, and pigs. They had strong beliefs about honesty. They didn�t like lying. One day, a man went to the section�s center to sell things.
�I have a baby pig for sale! It won�t cost much,� he said. He held the animal above his head. His style was different from honest people�s style. He was a master of tricking people and lying.
A woman named Beth scanned his pig. He offered her the pig for one gold coin. That was a very small amount. Beth gave him the coin. He put it in his pocket. He walked ahead of Beth to get the pig.
He gave her a closed bag and said, �Here�s your pig.� He then left very quickly.
Beth looked at the bag�s surface. It was moving. She opened it to let the pig out. A cat was inside! �He tricked me! That isn�t proper,� she said.
Later, the man returned to trick more people. Beth saw him and the memory of the cat came back. She told her friends. They stopped him. But no one knew what to do next.
Someone said, �We need an independent and fair person to decide that.� They went to the judge. Beth told him about the cat in the bag.
The judge asked, �Is there evidence? Can you demonstrate how he did it?�
�Look in his bag,� said Beth. She opened it and let a cat out of the bag. They learned the man�s secret, and he went to jail.
That�s how the idiom �let the cat out of the bag� came to mean to tell a secret.

This is a true story. It happened long ago in Greece....
�We must fight,� the Spartan* chief told his small army of brave men. They were at a great disadvantage. There were only three hundred of them. The Persian military had hundreds of thousands of men.
They were going to lose unless they could secure a small entrance. The enemy couldn�t move through it easily. They intended to stop the enemy here. The chief and his men got ready for the battle.
Soon, long lines of the enemy�s army twisted around the hills. The chief met the enemy with laughter. He knew that his men�s weapons and skills were better. The Spartans trusted their leader and obeyed him.
First, the enemy soldiers shot arrows from their bows. The chief told his men to lift their shields*. The arrows stuck into the shields but did not hurt any of the men.
Then the enemy�s soldiers attacked the Spartans with long spears. The chief surprised them. His troops rolled logs down on the enemy.
They fought for three days. Though they hardly slept at all, the chief and his men remained steady.
But the enemy found a way to beat the Spartans. The chief and all of his men were killed. Even though they lost, the Battle of Thermopylae is one of the most famous battles in history.

The Deer and His Image
A deer told himself every day, �I am the most handsome deer in the forest. My large chest is a symbol of my power. And my beautiful horns impress other animals.�
But he did not like his legs and hooves*. �My legs are narrow, and my hooves are ugly. They do not satisfy me.�
One day, the deer saw a big dog. The deer made some noise and disturbed the dog. The dog woke up and chased him. The deer felt terror. He screamed. He did not want to be a victim, so he ran into the forest. His strong legs helped him run fast. His pale brown hooves were hard, so they were not sensitive to rough rocks. However, his horns got caught in branches, slowing him down. His large chest could not fit between thick trees.
The deer estimated that he ran for an hour. He felt like he was running a marathon. In the end, the deer escaped the threat of the dog. He sat in the shade of a tree. �That was almost a disaster! I almost did not escape because of my chest and horns. My legs and hooves saved me.� As a consequence, the deer learned to honor his fast legs and have confidence in his strong hooves. �Pretty things only supplement important things,� he thought.

May 29,1953
Today is the most important day of my life. I finally climbed Mt. Everest, the tallest mountain in the world.
The top of the mountain was amazing. It felt like we were close to heaven. The snow was so thick that my boots sank. The air was silent. I looked at the beauty that surrounded me. Maybe my story will be a legend someday.
I want people to remember this forever. I was the senior explorer in my group, and I knew we needed proof of our climb. I took many pictures with my camera. I�ll put them in a frame and hang them.
On the mountain, the air was very cold. I wrapped my coat around my body. I looked over the side of the mountaintop. From that angle, I saw the border of the clouds touch the rocks below. The snow was thick. It looked pure. There was no sign of modern life. Thousands of years ago, my ancestors saw the world this way.
After fifteen minutes, I knew it was time to proceed down the mountain. The whole team congratulated us. My superior, John Hunt, praised us all. I sent messages to my relatives to tell them that I was safe. But it was hard to leave the mountain so quickly. I wanted to enjoy the incredible sight even longer.

One day, the cooks decided that they were tired of the abuse and that they would not be passive anymore. Everyone opposed the chef. At first, they thought about suing him. Instead, they tied up the chef with rope. Now, they controlled the restaurant! They decreased the price of food. They used the best ingredients and made large quantities of food. They turned on the lights. The restaurant was converted into a happy place. For the first time, many people came to eat.
The chef realized that the restaurant�s problems were his fault. The chef learned an important lesson. The new, generous chef insisted on giving the customers a free meal.

The Cat and the Fox
One day, a cat hiked on a mountain. When he reached the peak, he met a fox. They began talking about how they get away from their enemies.
�I am very smart. I have billions of ideas. I can carve a tiny hole in a tree, and then climb in,� the fox said. He added, �I have a lot of friends. If I am in trouble, I can call them to lend their help. I can escape an entire army if I have to!�
Then, the fox asked, �What are your potential plans?� The cat said, �I have only one plan.� The fox said, �I hope you have good fortune, then! Do you want me to be your tutor? I can teach you many things.� The cat said, �I guarantee that my plan works every time. We can quit talking about it.�
Soon, they saw a group of wolves. It was an emergency. The cat quickly used her plan. She ran up a tree. The fox could not decide which plan to use. �What should my initial move be? Should I consult my friends?� The fox felt intense anxiety. All he could do was spin in a circle. The wolves caught the fox. The cat was full of pride. This is proof that having a good plan is better than having many bad plans.

The Lucky Knife
I�ve devoted my life to studying past generations. Last year, I had a unique chance to work with my uncle. Our job was to find old treasures for a school�s history foundation. He also hired a crew of students. They signed a contract to work with him. He was the boss. The place was strange, though. I dined on many things that I had never tasted before. They had an unusual flavor.
We had been there about a month and hadn�t found anything. One day, I began to dig in the soil. The ground�s layers got wetter. Soon I was digging in the mud. My shovel began to get very heavy. It felt like it had doubled in weight because the ground had absorbed a lot of water.
Finally, I saw something in the mud. It was an old knife! The handle felt smooth in my hand. I elevated it so I could see it better. There was writing on it.
�It says it will bring good luck,� my uncle said with a smile. �Why don�t you keep it?�
I put it in my tent. The next day, we found many more things. There were pots, jewelry and weapons. My uncle donated all of the things to a special committee. Many newspapers wrote stories about it. It seemed the knife really did bring good luck!

Prince Sam
Sam�s mother cooked at the royal palace. One day, he went to work with her. She emphasized that he should stay in the kitchen. But Sam was bored. Thus, he decided to look around.
He went around a corner. It shocked him to see a boy who had a strong likeness to him. Sam soon recovered. The other boy stared at him. Then he spoke. �Come with me.�
He needed to be rational. But he couldn�t deny that he wanted to go. So he followed the boy to a chamber. �I am Prince Bertram,� the boy said.
Sam felt shy talking to a prince. �I�m Sam.�
�Trade places with me.� The prince said.
�We can�t. My mother will kill me. Moreover, I don�t know anything about being a prince.�
�No one will find out,� the prince interrupted. �We look the same, and even our gestures are the same. It will only last for a week.�
Sam said OK. Soon, Sam�s perspective on being a prince changed. He spent most of his day signing royal documents. At night, the prince�s chamber was cold. He thought he was going to freeze or get sick with a fever or the flu. He was happy when the week ended. So was the prince.
�I didn�t know how to do anything,� the prince said. �I�ve always relied on my servants to do everything for me.�
�I think I like being a regular person,� Sam said. �Being a prince isn�t fun.� So, they both returned to their normal positions and enjoyed their lives more than before.

Henry Ford�s Famous Car
My name is Henry Ford, and I invented a car called the Model T. I used to watch carriages on the streets. They fascinated me. Then I got a job as a junior mechanic. My father criticized me. He wanted me to run the farm. But I did not shift my plans.
Then I worked for the Detroit Auto Company. But I wanted to make cars using less labor. That way, there would be fewer expenses. I started the Ford Motor Company in 1903. At first, the company did not do well. But many people were betting on my success. I also had a sincere aim to make a car that anybody could buy.
Then, in 1908,1 introduced the Model-T in a formal ceremony. It confirmed that I was right: it was possible to build a car my way!
The Model T differed from other vehicles. Workers could attach different parts for cars or trucks. This saved time. One Model T could be put together in 93 minutes. All of them had the same classic design. They were all the same size and height. The prime reason for doing this was to save money.
Over 19 years, I sold over 15 million Model Ts. This sent a signal to other companies. People would buy cars to commute to work if the price was low enough.

When he got to the monks� house, they greeted him and let him in. The monks asked the priest, �What is the matter?� The priest said, �I should be happy, but I am not. I don�t know what to do.� The wise monks paused for a minute. Then one said, �We are convinced of your faith. You are a very good priest. But to find joy, you have to do more. Above all, investigate the elements of your life that you love.� The priest thought that this answer was odd, but he was curious.
The next day, the priest thought about his abilities. He got a few ideas, and he did not want to delay any longer. He liked to draw, so he made some cartoons. He also liked to write, so he started a diary. He was interested in agriculture, so he planted some grains. He made jam from berries. He made his own labels to put on the jars of jam. He painted his ceiling. The priest learned something. It is not too hard to be happy after all. All one has to do is find things they like doing, and do them!

Mrs. May and the Green Girl
One morning, people from a small town found a little girl by a stream. She seemed to be wearing a green costume. As the people got closer, they saw that the girl�s skin was green!
�Oh my!� The people exclaimed. �What if her motive for coming to our town is bad? What if she has a strange origin?�
An old woman kindly went to her. �Look how scared she is. Please,� she begged. �Do not reject her. I will adopt her.�
There was silence until the judge spoke. �I don�t know,� he said in a worried tone. �But we cannot forbid you. I indeed hope you�re not being a fool.�
Mrs. May extended her hand to the girl. �Come with me. I won�t hurt you.�
The girl spoke a language Mrs. May didn�t know. But she was able to interpret what the girl was trying to say. Sometimes the girl drew pictures to illustrate what she meant.
The green girl was from a place far beyond the sun. There, people lived in nests built in trees. They only ate green leaves, which made their skin green.
�Well, you can�t just eat leaves,� Mrs. May said. She fed the green girl home-cooked meals, and soon the girl wasn�t green anymore. The people had a huge reception to welcome her as a citizen of the town.

Albert Einstein
My name is Albert Einstein. Many people know about the great things I�ve accomplished. But I had many barriers before I became famous.
I was born in Germany. When I was in elementary school, I already knew about math and statistics. When I was a boy, I pretended to be a great scientist. I loved school, but my life at home was hard. My father lost his job, so my family lived in poverty. We could not pay the rent in Germany. We became immigrants and went to Italy. I finished high school and went to college in Switzerland.
After college, I began writing about science. I did not reach success in an instant, though. At first, other scientists did not approve of my work. They thought I was a failure. Rising to the rank of an admired scientist was a gradual process. Soon, people started to notice that I was right. At last, I began to get some recognition.
I showed how to find the approximate size of very big things, like stars. I also detected and explained the movement of very small things, like atoms. And for fun, I made a machine that could refrigerate food by inserting heat. I never retired. It was my duty to keep working. I overcame many hard times, and I will be remembered for my important works.

However, the tomb�s builder had a plan. Most of the stones were solid, but he put one special stone on the roof. It was made of a lighter substance.
When the tomb was done, the king moved in his stock of gold. One night, the builder went to the tomb. His excitement mounted. Because all the stones looked alike, he had left a distinct mark on the artificial block. The mark helped him distinguish the difference in the architecture.
The builder lifted the stone. Using a chain, he climbed into the tomb. He filled his pockets with gold.
The builder followed this manner night after night. Soon, the king noticed a shortage in his gold. This annoyed the king.
At last he hired a guard to hide inside the tomb. When the builder entered the tomb, the guard wounded him. He climbed a pole to the roof. The builder left drops of blood in the dust. The guard followed them and caught him.
When the builder healed, he explained to the king that he didn�t keep any of the gold. He had given it all away to the poor.

Once there was a shepherd. Every night he counted and gathered his sheep. He was sure never to overlook any of them. One night, he saw some wild sheep had joined his herd. He hoped to acquire the newcomers.
It snowed that night. In the morning, the shepherd couldn�t take his sheep out of his lodge. Instead, he had to feed them inside. He gave a small amount of wheat to his own sheep. But he gave more of the food to the wild sheep. He thought the extra wheat would discourage them from leaving.
It snowed for several days. During that time, the shepherd�s sheep ate very little. The wild sheep, however, ate very well.
At last, the snow melted, and they ventured outdoors. As soon as he opened the door of his hut, the wild sheep started to run away.
�Wait! This is how you repay me? After I treated you so kindly, why do you run away?� the shepherd asked. His voice was full of hatred.
The wild sheep stopped and turned toward the shepherd.
�We�re leaving because you fed us better than your own sheep,� one of the wild sheep replied. �You tried to deceive us with your ridiculous plan. Yesterday you treated us kindly, but tomorrow you might be different. If more wild sheep joined your herd, you would treat us as inferior sheep.�
As the wild sheep ran away, the shepherd understood his offense. He knew this awkward situation was his own fault. He had not been a satisfactory caretaker. He was a fake friend to the wild sheep. Because of this, he had neglected his own herd.

Trick-or-treat!
Many different cultures have had traditions about the dead. People in places like Ireland, China, Egypt and Mexico believed that souls needed food. They thought the food nourished them on their journey from cemeteries to heaven. People had to put out good things for souls to eat. However, if the food rotted or spoiled, the soul got mad. The wicked soul might curse the family and make them starve during the winter.
In other places, people begged for food on a holiday that remembers the souls of dead saints. People wore disguises with hoods that covered their faces. If they did not get food, they played a trick on the home. For this reason, the activity is known as �trick-or- treating.� Shortly after people first began trick-or-treating, parents started sending their children to beg on that day. Housewives gave the children food if they performed a song or a dance. When people moved to America from all over the world, they brought this tradition with them. Inhabitants of villages started trick-or-treating in the early 1900s. In 1939 a children�s publication acquainted the whole country with the tradition. It became very popular.
Today, trick-or-treaters are not begging for food, and they are not scared of souls. They just enjoy the thrill of dressing up like creatures and getting candy. Ghosts and skeletons are favorite costumes. But some children wear fancy disguises, like pirates. They carry flashlights instead of fires. In some places, children still perform songs or riddles to get candy. But most of the time, they just say �Trick-or-Treat!�

She became very famous. Visitors to Alaska were enthusiastic about meeting her. They brought presents for her. They liked seeing her and the feeling was mutual. The mayor said Patsy Ann should be called the town�s greeter*.
The people in town loved Patsy Ann, too, even though she lived on the streets. They were willing to fight to keep her. A new law made all dogs wear a collar and get shots. The mayor received many complaints. People wanted Patsy Ann to be able to stay. One ambitious sailor got people to help. Together, they paid for Patsy Ann to go to the veterinarian. She got her shots and collar. She could stay.
When Patsy Ann died, everyone missed the town�s loyal greeter. So the mayor hired someone to make a statue of Patsy Ann. He restored the town�s greeter. Now, she sits at the dock forever, waiting for ships to come home.
*greeter - a person whose job is to say hello to new people.

The Anniversary Gift
Joe was a carpenter. He built houses in the highlands. Joe�s wife Stella used a needle and thread to sew elegant clothing. She only used beautiful fabric to make clothes.
Since they didn�t have a lot of money, they lived in an old shed. Water dripped in when it rained. They had broken chairs instead of a couch. But they had coal for heat, and flour from the mill for bread. Together, they trimmed the bushes to make their house look nice. Joe and Stella were poor, but not ashamed. They were happy.
Sometimes in the evening, they walked downtown. They looked in store windows and dreamed. Stella wanted a hairbrush with an ivory handle. She pulled her hair upwards every day because she didn�t have a brush to make it nice. Joe wanted to fix his grandfather�s watch.
For their anniversary, Stella wanted to get Joe what he wanted. But then she did the arithmetic. It would take at least six months to save enough money. Then she had an idea. She cut off all of her hair and sold it.
Meanwhile, Joe knew that he could never fix his watch. So he polished it and sold it. He made enough to buy the brush.
On their anniversary, the door burst open. Joe was excited to give Stella his gift. But first, Stella gave him the money to fix the watch.

Now he was tired and thirsty. He was afraid. Being lost in the marsh could be fatal. When people entered it, they never came out.
At last, he found a pond. Flowers grew around it. The blossoms smelled like the best perfume. He felt relaxed so he drank some water and fell asleep. When he awoke, he saw an evil dwarf staring at him.
� What are you doing here?� it asked. The dwarf spoke in a strange dialect.

The people agreed with the knight�s plan.
The knight put on his armor, and the warriors got their spears. When the enemy attacked, the knight and warriors acted as if they were afraid. They quickly withdrew toward the mountain.
The enemy troops followed them up the steep path. Soon, the enemy became tired.
At the summit, the knight and his troops stopped. The enemy was close behind them. But now they were tired. Also, only a few could attack because the path was narrow. The knight and the warriors fought the enemy. But there were too many troops.
The knight was afraid. If the warriors yielded the path to the enemy, the town would be lost.
A storm suddenly came over the mountain. There was strong wind and rain. Thunder boomed. Lightning struck some trees near the enemy. The trees blazed. The flames scared the enemy and they retreated. They ran down the mountain, out of the town, and never returned.

Everyone is Special
When I was young, everything that went wrong in my house seemed to be my fault. Once, my brothers tried to make cookies. They blended flour and ginger and made a disgusting paste. Then they tried to wash it down the drain, but it got all over the floor. Later, my brothers said that I did it and I had to wipe it up.
I worried that my parents liked them more than me. One autumn day, I was sure I would make my parents proud. I bought a model rocket. After I put it together, I invited everybody to watch it. I wanted my brothers to envy my technical knowledge. I lit the fuse, but nothing happened.
� Looks like your fireworks don�t work. I hope you kept the receipt so you can return them,� my brother said.

Embarrassed, I ran inside and hid. A few minutes later, my mom asked, � Are you OK?�

Pizarro and the Inca Gold
According to rumors, there�s lots of precious gold hidden in the jungles of Peru. It got there when the Spanish conquered parts of South America. The Spanish noble, Francisco Pizarro, arrived in Peru in the 1500s. He found a group of people called the Incas. The Incas believed that their leader, Atahualpa, was both a king and a god. But Pizarro didn�t agree.
� It is a sin for a man to think he is God!� he said to Atahualpa.
Atahualpa thought Pizarro was insulting his heritage. He thought the blonde Spanish men held prejudices against the Incas. But Atahualpa was a kind man and didn�t want to fight the Spaniards. He said, � If I give you a room full of gold, will you leave my country in peace?�
Pizarro was suspicious. He thought Atahualpa was exaggerating. But a few days later, Pizarro returned to the Inca palace with his ambassadors. He saw a room filled with stacks of gold. There were golden necklaces, cups, plates and vases. It was a great spectacle. He acknowledged that Atahualpa had told the truth. But after seeing the gold, he wanted all of Peru�s gold. So he didn�t leave the country.
The Spanish soldiers stayed in Peru and grabbed all the gold they could find. But the Inca people tricked the Spaniards. They mixed the gold with tin so that it was poor quality. They gave this gold to the Spaniards. Meanwhile, they hid the good gold. They stuffed it into sacks and dragged it deep into the jungle. The Spanish conquerors never found the gold. People think it is still there today.

The grandfather glanced at the next picture and frowned. It showed a row of coffins. His grandson noticed the grief in his grandfather�s face.
� What is it?� the boy inquired.
� This was after a nuclear bomb was dropped,� the grandfather answered. � It devastated a city.�
Next the grandfather pulled a toy microscope from the box and rotated it in his hand.
� Where did you get that?� the grandson asked.
� This is a souvenir I bought at the science museum,� the grandfather said.
Now the boy was really interested. He started to understand that his grandfather was telling him a larger story. It was the story of his grandfather�s life.
He got another photo. It showed a young bride and groom. They were very happy. A certificate was attached to the photo. The boy couldn�t read it, but he traced his finger over paper.
� What�s this from, Granddad?� he asked.
� That�s my marriage license from the day I married your grandmother,� the grandfather said.
� Wow!� said the boy. � Granddad, now I know all about your life!�

The Kitten and the Caterpillar
Katie the kitten liked to play. One day, Cory the caterpillar emerged from a hole in the wall while Katie was playing in the living room.
� Hey!� Katie yelled. � Do you want to play with me?�
Cory was reluctant. He said, � I�d rather not play with you. I have several handicaps. My body is very delicate. Your claws are as sharp as hooks. You might cut me. Plus, I have no bones, not even a spine. You could easily hurt me.�
� I swear that I won�t hurt you,� Katie said.
� No, I don�t want to,� he said again. He hopped from the wall, but Katie pursued him.
Cory ran into the kitchen and into the cupboard, but Katie chased closely behind. Katie knocked appliances to the floor. Plates fell into the sink and broke in the basin.
Then he ran into a bedroom. Some laundry was on the floor. Cory hid under a shirt, but Katie saw him. She jumped on the shirt. Her paws left stains on the cloth, and her claws ripped the sleeves into strips.
However, Cory escaped. He utilized a small crack in the floor to hide. But Katie saw him.
� Now you are trapped!� said Katie.
Cory tried to avoid Katie�s claws. He moved his body as far into the hole as possible. He didn�t know how he�d get out of the hole.
Just then, Katie�s owner came home. She saw that the house was a mess. She took a broom and swung it at Katie. She chased Katie out of the house.
Cory was safe, and Katie was left outside because she didn�t listen to the wishes of others.

The History of Chocolate
Many people believe that chocolate originally came from Europe. However, chocolate, called the �food of the gods,� was first made in the Americas. The first chocolate was very different from contemporary chocolate.
Wild chocolate trees can grow easily in the humid Amazon rain forest. Clusters of flowers growing on these trees turn to seeds. About 20 to 60 cacao beans can be found in the seeds. Cacao beans are the ingredient needed to create sweet, soothing, and delicious chocolate treats.
The Mayan and Aztec cultures both thought that chocolate trees were brought from paradise by gods. The Mayans and Aztecs used the beans from this divine tree to create a special beverage with a very pleasant odor. Surprisingly, the Aztecs believed that it would be toxic to women and children.
In the 1500s, the Spanish explorer Cortes met the Aztecs. Cortes became quite interested in the plantations where the Aztecs cultivated chocolate trees. When he returned to Europe, he took cacao beans with him. He introduced the people of Spain to the Aztecs� chocolate beverage.
Over the next 100 years or so, kings, queens, and members of the upper class enjoyed drinking chocolate. They enjoyed it even more once they learned to add sugar to the beverage! Soon, chocolate had spread all across Europe. New machines allowed chocolate makers to perfect their products and produce them at a very rapid rate. Preparing the beans in special ways brought out the aroma of chocolate. The beans were combined with condensed milk to give the chocolate a smooth texture.
Today, contemporary chocolates with subtle flavors fill the shelves of expensive chocolate shops. The different types of chocolate available today vary widely. True chocolate lovers can tell which is best, though. They will tell you that the flavor of high quality chocolate stays on the palate long after you finish it.

Monkey Island
In the middle of the ocean, there is a small island shaped like an arc. Here, monkeys play on the beach and in the trees. But how did the monkeys get there?
Once, an English admiral was exploring Africa when he found hundreds of monkeys. The admiral�s character was mean. He thought, �I could sell these monkeys and become very rich! I�m going to take them to England.�
So the admiral set traps to catch the monkeys. He put stakes in the ground, tied string around them and made loops in the string. When the monkeys ran through the forest, their feet got caught in the loops, and they couldn�t escape. Then the admiral put the monkeys in cages on his ship and sailed away.
The cages were small and uncomfortable. There was no soft hay for the monkeys to sleep on. Instead, they slept on branches with sharp thorns that cut into the monkeys� flesh. For dinner, he gave them tiny pieces of sour grapefruit to eat. The monkeys grew hungry and weak.
But one day, the admiral hired a new steward. He was a kind man with a good conscience. He was horrified to see the thin monkeys in the cages. So one night he let them out.
The monkeys ran and played all over the ship! They attacked the admiral and the steward and ate their food. They completely wrecked the ship. One monkey ran into a kerosene lamp, and it fell over. The ship caught fire and began to sink! The whole crew was lost except for the monkeys.
After the accident, the monkeys jumped onto a raft. They floated away from the fiery blaze of the ship. In the morning, they saw a little island in the distance. The monkeys used a piece of wood as a paddle, and they went toward it. They found the island shaped like an arc. They felt so happy to find a new home, and they still live there today.

The Young Man and the Old Man
A proud young man was looking for a new pastime. He heard about people hiking in the national parks and decided to try it for himself. As he started his stroll, an old man walked up to him.
�Don�t go this way,� the old man said. �Beware. The paths are not clear. It�s easy to become lost.�
But the young man disagreed with the old man and bragged that he had a perfect understanding of the park. �I studied maps of this area,� he told him. �I believe I have a thorough knowledge of these trails. I won�t become lost.�
The old man listened to the young man and then admonished him for his pride.
�I have walked these trails my entire life,� he said. �If you think you will be safe, then go ahead.�
The young man ignored the old man and started along the trail.
Whenever he had to choose between an easy or difficult route, he always chose the more difficult option. In addition, he was not conscious of which direction he was going. After a while, he decided to return home. Because his course through the wilderness was so indirect, he had no idea where he was.
He looked at his map but could not pinpoint his location. He walked one path after another but soon realized he was lost.
The sun was going down, and sudden strong winds gave a hint that it might rain. Immense clouds filled the sky. Awesome sounds of thunder were audible from all directions. It echoed off the mountains. The thought of the eventual storm tormented the young man. He hurried in one direction, but soon switched out of confusion. Luckily, it led him out of the park.
When he arrived home, he knew that he had acted like an idiot. He realized he was lucky to be alive. He decided to listen to people with more experience than himself.

The Tricky Fox
There was a fox that lived in the forest. Fox loved to play mean tricks on the other animals. One day, he used the sharp rim of a bottle to dig a pit in the ground. He hid in a tree until Rabbit came to the pit�s edge. Then, he jumped out and pushed Rabbit into the pit. Fox laughed and ran away. The angry Rabbit climbed out and told the other animals what happened.
The others said, �That is typical behavior for Fox. He does mean things all the time. Sometimes, he is completely immoral. We all disapprove of his actions, so we should teach him a lesson. Tomorrow, we�ll push Fox into that pit.�
The next day, all of the animals hid near the pit and waited for Fox. Fox was oblivious to the hidden animals. He walked up to the pit to see if Rabbit was still trapped. Just then, the other animals ran up to Fox and pushed him in. All the animals laughed and cheered, except Fox, of course.
Fox couldn�t get out! The walls of the pit were covered in damp ivy. It was too slippery for him to climb out. He was utterly helpless. He moaned and began to weep.
At last, he saw Eagle watching him from her roost. He yelled, �Eagle, please help me! If I don�t get out of here, I will perish!�
Eagle said, �You may think your tricks are trivial, but you hurt others when you do mean things. I�ll help you if you promise to be nice.�
Fox said, �I promise!�
Eagle began her flight to the bottom of the pit. She picked up Fox with her beak and soared out of the pit. She dropped Fox safely on the ground.
Fox thanked Eagle and kept his promise. He was nice to the other animals. The animals even became fond of Fox, and the forest was happy place.

The Magic Computer
I had a difficult geography project to finish by the end of the semester. My teacher wanted it to be typewritten, so I went to the school computer room. But when I got there, all the computers were turned off. Apparently there was a recent problem, and technicians were fixing it.
I knew of some private study rooms downstairs. They were small and dark, and the computers were very old, but I had no choice. At least the computers were operating correctly. I typed and highlighted the assignment�s title: �Evaluate the Government�s Response to Global Warming.� But I didn�t know what to write in my essay. Finally I decided to find a book to help me. I went to the library, checked the book indexes and eventually found a useful book. Then I returned to the computer.
When I looked at the screen, I saw something so weird that I nearly fainted! The essay was complete! Had somebody in cyberspace written it? I didn�t know, but I was very happy. I printed it out and handed it in. I got an �A.�
After that, I used the computer for all my assignments. I�d type the title, wait awhile, and the computer would do it. Every assignment was perfect; I never had to edit anything. I stopped paying attention to my teacher�s lectures and spent my extra time in the gymnasium. And my grades got better and better.
A month later, I was walking into class when my friend said, �Are you prepared for the test?�
�What test?� I asked.
�The geography test!� he replied. �I hope you studied. It�s worth seventy percent of our final grade!�
I failed the test, of course. I was completely ignorant about the subject. After that, I made a resolution never to use the magic computer again. The moral of this story is that if you cheat at school, you won�t learn anything.

Jack Frost and the Pudding
Every winter, a magical boy with a wild spirit named Jack Frost arrives in town. He wears a white cape, and his role is to cover everything with frost and ice. But Jack Frost also gets pleasure from playing tricks on common folks.
One dark winter evening, he was sitting on the rail of a fence near a river, pointing at some trees. When he did so, there was a pop, and the trees were evenly covered in frost.
Then old Tom Muggins came along the path. He was carrying a basket of ingredients for his wife�s cake recipe. �I�ll have some fun with him!� said Jack Frost. He pointed, and suddenly there was a patch of ice on the path. Poor Tom slipped and fell into the river. The bags of flour, fruit and sugar fell open and got wet. A couple of eggs broke, and a stick of butter shrank in the water. Tom gathered the ingredients and climbed out of the river. The food made an absolute mess of the path. �Alas!� he cried. �There�ll be no cake for me!�
Jack Frost laughed at poor Tom because his nice suit got soaked as well. �Are you cold?� he said. �Don�t worry, I�ll make you warm!� He pointed at the mess in Tom�s basket. Suddenly, there was a spark. What was left of the food caught fire! Jack Frost ran off laughing.
Poor Tom sat by the fire. He could only envision how angry his wife would be. He wished he had been more attentive and noticed that Jack was around.
Suddenly, a pleasant smell came from the basket. Tom looked inside. The butter was melting and the eggs were starting to cook! Even the fruit began to simmer. Soon there was a fat, brown pudding in the basket! Tom tasted it. It was delicious! He happily took it home for dessert. Although Jack Frost had tried to make Tom�s life difficult, Jack had actually made Tom a wonderful pudding!

The Architect�s Plan
An architect wanted to build a new office building. He selected some land that seemed perfect. He planned to cut down the trees to make room for the building. But there was a problem ... a big problem.
The land was actually the habitat of several types of birds. Some nature lovers were very upset with the architect. First, they held a rally and told others about the issue. Then, they decided to take legal action because the architect didn�t respect the animals� rights.
To resolve the problem, they asked a judge to intervene.
The judge could not call any witnesses for the nature lovers, so he first asked the architect to tell his side of the story.
�Why are you going to destroy the birds� habitat?� the judge asked.
The architect replied, �I have the deed to the land. I want to make a great building there. As you may know, all my buildings become memorable landmarks.�
Then one of the nature lovers spoke. �We believe that there�s no reason to destroy all the trees. We just want to protect the birds.�
Then the judge made his decision. �I proclaim that the office building should be built,� he said. �It is not a crime to remove those trees. I cannot give you a sentence for any offenses, but I feel obliged to make one request. I will only allow you to use half of the land. The other half will remain free, so the birds have a place to live.
The nature lovers could not conceal their gratitude. All of the people cheered.
The architect said, �I have an idea. I will volunteer my time and efforts to design a new type of building. It will provide bushes on the roof where birds can live. There are enough resources in my company�s bank account to create the best building ever made.�
The architect did exactly as he promised. He built this new type of building, which was loved by everyone.

Janie and the Music Player
Janie had constant thoughts about getting a music player. One day, she was late to class. She hurried down the hall but halted when she saw a backpack on the floor. She looked inside and found nothing but some books. She reached inside the bag and felt a small object at the bottom. It was a music player enclosed in a black case! Janie tended to be honest, and she had no valid reason to take the device. However, her desire for the player influenced her decision. Janie was being sly. She put the device into her own backpack. When she arrived at class, she gave her teacher the bag. �I found this,� she said.
Ms. Johnson asked, �Does this backpack belong to anyone?� A girl named Linda claimed the bag. Linda looked inside and yelled, �My music player is missing! Janie took it!� Janie answered, �I did not.� Linda responded, �You were the only one that had access to it! If your version of the story is true, you�ll let Ms. Johnson check your bag.� Janie started to perspire as she realized the impending trouble she was in. She gripped her bag tightly.
Ms. Johnson took the bag from Janie. Inside she found the player. �Janie, I never expected this kind of conduct from you,� she said. �You�ve always been such a good student.�
Ms. Johnson gave Linda the player. Linda said, �Ms. Johnson, look!� There was a crack along one side. She turned it to the �on� mode, but it wouldn�t work. It must�ve snapped while Janie was holding onto the bag so tightly.
Ms. Johnson called Janie�s parents. They were very upset. �Stealing is illegal. You have no respect for the law whatsoever,� they said. �We bought you a music player, but we�re giving it to Linda. It will replace the one you broke.� In the end, Janie�s bad behavior left her with nothing at all.

Anton�s Great Discovery
Anton Van Leeuwenhoek was a Dutch cloth merchant. His life began to change after he got his first microscope in 1653. It was a very simple microscope. It had a lens in an upright stand. It could make small things look large. It was handy for looking closely at cloth.
Soon, Anton felt a longing to build a more powerful microscope. He dreamed of using it to make an important scientific discovery. He wanted to become famous. Three decades later, he did.
For many years, Anton experimented with microscopes and lenses. Eventually he constructed a very powerful microscope. If he had sold the concept to others, it would have made him very rich. However, Anton refrained from surrendering his secret to anyone. Instead, he wanted to use it to become famous. So he used his secret microscope to study the natural world.
One day he was looking at saliva from his mouth with the microscope. In the saliva, he saw numerous tiny particles. Some of them were moving! He thought that the particles were tiny organisms. So he isolated them from each other and studied each one carefully. Then he classified them into different categories. Some were round. Others were long and had tails. All were alive.
Anton was so excited. He knew he could become famous now. He was the first person to see these tiny organisms. So he drew diagrams of the organisms and sent them to a group of scientists in London. The scientists were sophisticated men who did not believe tiny, animate organisms could live in our mouths. Anton made a plea for them to come to Holland to see the organisms with their own eyes. The men took a ferry to Holland and met Anton. They performed a careful review of his work, and they conceded that he had made a worthwhile discovery. Anton Van Leeuwenhoek had discovered bacteria. After decades of hard work, he had become famous.

How a Singer Helped Win the War
Sometimes famous people are vain. They only care about themselves. But Josephine Baker was an exception. In the 1930s and 1940s, Baker was one of the most famous women in France. She was a big part of the new jazz genre and culture and had a diverse group of fans. The French people especially loved her. And she loved France. So when World War II started, she wanted to help the nation that had given her so much.
In 1940, armed German troops entered Paris. When this happened, some French people formed a secret alliance. It was called the French Resistance. The group worked for the defense of France. It helped the European and American armies fight the Germans.
Baker was an important member of the Resistance. She had three jobs. The first was to carry messages to and from other members. The messages were written in code on her sheets of music. The second was to provide shelter and supply goods to Resistance members. It would have been dangerous if the Germans found them.
Baker�s third job was the most important. Baker held concerts for European politicians and army members. She lured them in, promising an entertaining show. She enchanted them with her singing and dancing and got lots of applause. But Baker was always equipped with a small notebook at these concerts. She listened for details about the war and wrote them down. Baker sorted the details and gave authoritative reports to the Resistance.
Some thought Baker�s fame would be an obstacle. The Germans knew who she was, but they didn�t think she was smart enough to work for the Resistance. So she could get information from the Germans easily. This helped the Resistance and the French army save lives and win the war.
Baker had a big impact on the Resistance�s work. She got many awards for her help. When she died, the army had a special ceremony to thank her again for her bravery.

The Sun listened as the North Wind talked with enthusiasm about how powerful he was and how he could push something from one continent to another with one breath. He said, �I am the strongest thing in the sky.�
�Really?� asked the Sun. �How do you know that you are more powerful than the stars, or the rain, or even me?�
The North Wind laughed with disrespect. He yelled, �You? That�s a joke!�
This hurt the Sun. He was usually timid and did not want to cause conflict. Today he decided that he should teach the North Wind a lesson.
In the meantime, a man began walking along the avenue down on Earth. When the Sun looked down on the terrain below, he saw the man. He pointed down to the Earth and said, �Do you see that man walking below? I bet I can get his jacket off of him. Can you?�
�Of course!� the North Wind replied as he took a deep breath and filled his lungs with air. He used all of his muscles in his face and belly to blow winds at his target in succession.
The harsh air currents made the man cold. The man pulled his jacket more tightly around him. It did not come off. The Sun decided to rescue the man from the mischief of the North Wind. He said, �May I try?� Then he sent down sunlight that made the man warm. The man leaned against a tree. He took off his jacket and enjoyed the nice weather.
�You are very powerful,� the Sun said to the North Wind, �but you use violence in your bid to appear strong. You should think of an alternative. The strongest people don�t use force to get what they want.�

Alex thought that it was a subconscious way that his brain was trying to warn him about something. He was going to run in a race that day. Did the dream mean he was going to lose? He became irritable.
�Good morning,� said Alex�s mother. �I brewed some coffee and made you a special breakfast.� Alex didn�t want it. It had too much sugar. He needed something nutritious. So he prepared a meal that contained a lot of protein to maximize his energy for the race. Then his father asked, �Do you want help packing your stuff?� �No,� replied Alex. He wanted to make sure that he had all of his equipment for the race.
Alex�s family got in their van and drove to the track. When they arrived, a boy ran toward Alex. �Can I have your autograph?� asked the boy. Alex had many fans. He usually charmed everybody he spoke to. However, today Alex refused to give the boy his signature. He needed to think about his race.

Beads of sweat formed out of Alex�s sweat glands. All he could think about was his terrible dream. He thought it might be his destiny to become a loser. While he was thinking, he didn�t hear the horn that meant the race had started.

The Brothers and the Bread
Two brothers wanted to go outside and play. However, because the only bread in the house was stale, their mother told them they needed to bake fresh bread.
�I have to have the car repaired,� she said. �When I return, if the bread is ready, you can play.�
The brothers hurried to prepare the bread, but not carefully. They didn�t sift the flour. They were careless and sprinkled too much salt into the mixture. The dough needed to be soft and flexible, but the salt made it into a lump that was as hard as a brick.
The younger brother uttered a sigh. �Now we have to start again,� he said.
�No, we don�t,� the older brother replied. �I�ll fix it. I just need to make the dough flat again and add water to it.�
He decided to hit the ball of dough with his fist to make it flat. But he hit it so hard that it flew right off of the table and knocked over a glass, which shattered. The dough then crashed into the kitchen window�s shutters and crumbled. Luckily, the brothers were not injured, but they did make a huge mess.
A slight mistake now became a major problem. The brothers had ruined the kitchen. Just then their mother returned. She saw the mess and became flushed with anger.
�Now you can�t play,� she said. �Instead, you have to clean the kitchen. I want this kitchen to be so clean that it may sparkle!�
The brothers cleaned the floor and expressed their sorrow to their mother. Soon, they were reconciled. But there was no bread, and it was too late to play. They realized that trying to do something quickly often makes more work.

Laika, the Space Dog
One of the world�s most beloved space travelers was also the furriest. Laika was a little dog living on the streets of Moscow, Russia. She matured on the streets because no one would give her a home. She had to learn how to live without eating much. She found ways to keep warm in a very cold climate. Scientists thought a tough dog like Laika would do well in a project they were putting together.
In a prior launch, Russia had put the first man-made object into space. Now, scientists wanted to see if a living thing could go to space. Although many facts about space had been learned, they weren�t enough to help send humans to space safely.
Laika and two other dogs were chosen to help scientists with their research. The animals were used in a variety of tests. In the end, though, only Laika would go to space. On November 3,1957 the Sputnik 2 spaceship was due to leave Earth.
Scientists carefully applied wires to Laika�s skin to measure her body�s reactions once she got into space. Laika also wore a special leash. Without it, she would float around in the spaceship. Soon after, Laika left the planet. Scientists on Earth awaited information from the ship.
But in the midst of so much excitement, something very sad happened. Scientists were able to tell that Laika was under a lot of stress. The trip confused and scared her. Laika�s entire ship had become as hot as a furnace. Scientists were powerless to help the dog in her misery. After about five hours, Laika died.
Some have complained that the little dog should never have been used in the mission. Scientists knew that she would not survive the trip. Laika was never buried, but a memorial has been established in Moscow. There are many songs and books about her, too. It seems that Laika became a hero to many people.

After they set up the camp, they went for a walk. Tracy�s father, Mr. Grieves, showed them the native plants and animals. �Look,� he said, �that�s a fox�s den. Do you see that bunch of mushrooms next to it. Don�t touch them. They contain poison.� Kara was bored. She didn�t care about nature.
As the day went on, mighty clouds soon loomed in the distance. �It looks like stormy weather,� said Tracy. �We should go back.� It suddnely began to rain. They used an umbrella to shield them from the rain. Back at the camp, they ate cold sandwiches for dinner and went to sleep.
By morning, the rain had stopped. It was a drastic change from the previous day�s weather. They folded their sleeping bags and put them in a box. Tracy closed the lid and told Kara, �Today will be fun, I promise!� Kara didn�t believe her. She missed her convenient life in the city. She was used to an urban lifestyle.
After breakfast, they went for a walk. The grass was covered with dew, and it gleamed in the sunlight. Finally, they reached a lake. Kara and Tracy waded into the water. The reeds swayed in the wind, and a flock of birds flew above. Kara felt very peaceful.

Robby said, �Do you want to practice the scene on the staircase? It�s the part where the migrant searches for a new job.�
Peter declined the invitation. �I can�t today. I need to do some errands.� Then he slammed the door. It was just an excuse. Peter didn�t want to help Robby.
On the day of auditions, Peter wore his lucky leather jacket. He always got the best part when he wore it. The teacher told him to begin, but his mind was blank. He couldn�t remember the lines!
A week later, the teacher put a list of the parts on the wall. Peter read the list, looking for his name. He was shocked by what he saw. He blinked his eyes and looked again. He didn�t get the lead part�Robby did! Peter pondered the situation and came to the idea that Robby justly received the part. He earned it by practicing. Next time, Peter would practice, too.

Isaac�s First Plane Trip
Isaac�s family was going on vacation. He was excited about the trip except for one thing. He had never been on a plane before. He was scared that his plane would have a breakdown.
Isaac got onto the plane. He walked down the aisle until he found his seat. He sat down and connected the ends of his seat belt. After being idle for a few minutes, the pilot announced that they were ready to leave.
He looked out the window at the vivid colors of the sky. He began to feel scared. The girl sitting next to him said, �Hi, I�m Rachel! You look nervous, but you don�t need to be. Flying is fun!�
�I�m still a bit nervous,� Issac said, �and I�m getting hungry.�
�The food service will begin soon. Just lower the tray on the seat in front of you, and flip this switch. Then they�ll bring your dinner! Last time, they served chicken, peas, and a box of raisins,� Rachel explained.
Then the pilot notified the passengers of bad conditions in the atmosphere. �We�re tracking the weather: lightning, clouds, etc. The ride might get a bit rough,� he stated.
Suddenly, the plane started to shake. Isaac was badly afflicted by his fear. His stomach hurt, and he thought he might vomit. He couldn�t believe that he was in such an unfortunate place. Finally, the shaking stopped. Isaac was still scared, but he tried to retain a good attitude.
�The first time I flew, the plane shook so bad that cargo started falling. My parents told me to listen to music and read a chapter in my book. It calmed me,� Rachel said.
Suddenly, the plane shook again. This time, Isaac followed Rachel�s advice. He put on headphones and took out a book by his favorite author. The book and the music helped Isaac feel better. After a while, he didn�t even notice the bad weather. The bad situation didn�t feel so bad after someone helped him.

The Betrayal
A king lived in a fort with his daughter, Clara. The king had founded a great empire, but his land was rife with enemies who wanted to take over the kingdom. Because there was so much civil unrest, the king told Clara not to trust anyone.
One day, Clara was walking outside when she saw a girl sweeping the path. Clara crossed the garden, and they started talking. The girl�s name was Susie. Clara felt sorry for Susie because she was very poor, and Clara gave her a bracelet. After that, Susie and Clara met every day.
Once, the King saw them talking. He told Clara, �Don�t talk to that girl. She could be an enemy.�
�You can�t distrust everyone,� commented Clara. �She is my sole friend. It�s OK to be friendly to people.�
The King said, �Don�t argue with me. Stay inside from now on, and talk to no one.�
Clara felt lonely in the fort. But one day she saw Susie outside. She wrote her a note with a map showing a secret entrance to the fort. Clara wrote: �Come at night, and we can talk together. Don�t show anybody this note.� She threw the note to Susie, and Susie tucked it in the lining of her dress.
That night Clara waited for Susie. But she heard something ticking, and then a loud blast. She ran into the hall, and it was full of smoke, which made her choke. A mass of soldiers were there, fighting. Clara realized that Susie had betrayed her and given the map to her father�s enemies. Clara prayed that everyone in the castle would be safe from her friend�s treachery.
At last, the fighting ceased. Clara found her father in the hall with his soldiers. They had defeated their enemies, but there were dents in their armor from the heavy fighting. Clara told her father what she had done and promised never to disobey him again.

The Teller and the Thieves
A teller at a bank suspected some of her fellow employees of not being very trustworthy. She thought they were stealing. In order to catch them, though, she needed some way to link them to the crime.
She had a background in religion and folklore. She remembered that one religion�s literature had a myth that chronicled how a group of thieves was captured.
In the millennium-old story, coins of copper were covered with venom taken from a poisonous snake. The coins were left as bait for the robbers. When they touched the coins, the venom infected their bodies through their skin. The venom ran through their veins, and they all became very sick as if they had a disease. It made their skin purple. The police arrested whoever had purple skin.
She knew she couldn�t use venom because it might hurt someone. However, she thought of a way to update the old story. She decided to cover a sum of money with a special powder. If people touched the money, the powder would cause their skin to itch. She placed the stack of money in the bank�s safe. No one was supposed to take money from the safe. If somebody did, then they had to be stealing.
Within a few hours, three of her coworkers were scratching their hands and arms. They itched so badly that they couldn�t even work. She checked the money, and it was gone. She told her boss what she had done, and he had the thieves arrested. He thanked her and promoted her.
Because events from history often repeat, ancient literature had helped the teller solve a crime. She proved that stories from the past still relate with the problems of today, and they can be helpful in solving problems.

The Scribe�s Warning
A great and powerful empire needed the wood from its western areas to build palaces and homes for the emperor and his friends. However, the empire had depleted many of the forests. The trees were important to the western areas� economy. With no trees to sell, the commerce in that area was reduced. Citizens could no longer purchase the goods that they needed to survive. Their life became difficult.
A poor scribe from the area wanted to help. He hitchhiked to the capital to ask the emperor for charity. He was invited to the palace. It was large and cozy. Tables were loaded with food, and fires burned warmly in every fireplace.
The emperor sat up upon his throne, and the scribe stood in front of him.
�I�ve come to ask for help,� the scribe said. �We�re all very poor and hungry. You�ve used up all of the forests, and now we have nothing to sell.� Then he added a warning. �If we don�t receive help, I�m afraid that the entire empire will suffer. We must establish some unity.�
Upon hearing the scribe�s request, the emperor�s bad temper surfaced. He mocked the scribe. �You think I should help,� he said and laughed. �You should just be happy to belong to this great empire. You will get nothing from me.�
The emperor felt no pity for the citizens of the western area. They were condemned to starve. The scribe returned home with nothing.
Not long after, an enemy invaded the empire from the west. They were marching to the capital. Because the citizens felt persecuted by the emperor, they remained neutral. They didn�t fight the invaders but allowed them to march freely to the capital.
The emperor was defeated. If he had heeded the words of the scribe, then the citizens might have been the victors. But because he had treated them badly, they treated him badly in return.

How the Dinosaurs Really Died
Many scientists and intellectuals think that dinosaurs died when an asteroid smashed into the Earth millions of years ago. However, recently, there has been some controversy over this theory. Some scientists think that it isn�t accurate. They think that a tiny insect may have been the biggest factor in the death of these huge creatures. That insect was the mosquito.
These scientists do think that an asteroid hit the Earth the time of the dinosaurs. But that wasn�t what killed all of them. At that time, insects, including the mosquito, were beginning to evolve. Today, we can regulate the number of mosquitoes with pesticides. But that was impossible millions of years ago. The mosquitoes multiplied quickly. And they were certainly not idle. Since there were so many mosquitoes, it was easy for them to bite many of the dinosaurs. When they bit another living thing, the mosquitoes passed along a deadly disease. So the dinosaurs were stricken with the disease. A vast majority of them, from the vegetarians to the meat eaters, died.
To reinforce this idea, scientists stress how gradually the dinosaurs died. If an asteroid killed them, they would have died very quickly. But the number of dinosaurs decreased slowly. In addition, scientists have found genetic material of mosquitoes in fossils. This material proves that mosquitoes existed back then. Although there may have been other factors, the dinosaurs died mainly because of disease, the scientists say.
No matter how it happened, the dinosaurs� death had a major impact on other living things. Many dinosaurs ate mammals. After the dinosaurs died, mammals were able to evolve and produce offspring. Birds also evolved. Scientists have analyzed the genomes of birds, and they discovered that birds have identical genetic material to some dinosaurs. So there may still be dinosaurs among us after all.

The Traveler and the Innkeeper
A traveler stopped at an inn. He sat and watched people closely, like a predator. He heard the old innkeeper talking to a young man in the core of the inn.
�I just need to borrow some money. I swear that I�ll spend it in moderation, and my friend will pay you back tomorrow,� the man said. The innkeeper gave his consent and pulled out some money.
The traveler knew that this was a trick. The man was going to leave with the poor innkeeper�s money and never return. He felt compassion for the nice innkeeper and did not want him to be tricked. The cunning traveler decided to teach the innkeeper a lesson.
The traveler walked over to the innkeeper and sat down. The innkeeper had started to grind coffee beans to make coffee. He made the coffee and handed the traveler a saucer and a cup. The two started talking. After a while the traveler yawned and then growled like a wolf.
�Are you not sane? I thought I just heard you growl,� said the innkeeper.
�I did. I am cursed. Every time I yawn three times in a row, I turn into a wolf and attack people.�
The innkeeper became tense. Then the traveler yawned again. As the traveler started to yawn a third time, the innkeeper turned to run outside. As he ran, the traveler snatched his coat. The scared innkeeper staggered outside and tumbled into the street.
The traveler followed him out because he did not want to withhold the truth any longer. He just wanted to foster happiness and restore the innkeeper�s emotional equilibrium. The innkeeper was dizzy, and he stumbled. The traveler helped him stand up.
�That was a trick,� the traveler said as he returned the coat.
�Oh, good. I cherish this coat,� responded the innkeeper.
�Well, hopefully this will teach you that you shouldn�t believe every story that you hear.�

Gilbert and the Lizard
Eliza disliked Australia. Firstly, she�d had to spend twenty uncomfortable hours on an aircraft getting here. She wanted to go to the beach, but her husband was a zoology professor and wanted to look for some interesting animals. So now she was traversing a swamp in the midday heat.
�Let me sit down, Gilbert. I�m not hardy like you,� she said, eventually.
They sat under a tree. There were lots of birds in that secluded, rural place, and they watched them flying overhead.
Then suddenly Gilbert saw something on a rock. �That�s strange,� said Gilbert. �That looks like a Red Swamp Lizard, but I thought that species was extinct.� He carefully picked it up. �Yes, it is! I�m going to take it back to the Zoology Institute. They will be filled with so much jealousy when they see what I have found!�
�Are you sure we should take it from its home?� asked Eliza.
�Nonsense, many animals migrate. They�re used to changes,� said Gilbert.
�Hmm, I don�t agree with the principle of it,� said Eliza. �It isn�t ethical.� But Gilbert was decisive and took the lizard back to the hotel in the city. He thought that this find would make him a highly esteemed celebrity at the Zoology Institute.
For the next few days, Gilbert fed and nurtured the lizard. But the lizard wasn�t happy. It lost its beautiful red color and began to look ordinary. In fact, Gilbert started to wonder whether it was special at all. He went outside and found a common lizard on a piece of concrete. When he compared them, they looked exactly alike. The lizard was only red in the swamp!
Gilbert said to Eliza, �I�m going to return this lizard to the swamp. I�ve learned an important lesson. Home is where we are happiest. At home, we are special like the red lizard. We can never be so happy when we are away.�
�Good,� said Eliza. �So, can we go home now?�

The Forest People
Colonel Wilbur and his wife Mary were flying over the tropics in their private plane. But suddenly the engine caught fire. It was impossible to extinguish the fire, so they were forced to land in the forest.
�What are we going to do?� said Mary. �Can you fix the plane?�
Wilbur said, �That�s impossible. I am not a technician, and the plane is out of gasoline. We�ll have to find help.�
Wilbur and Mary walked through the forest. It was difficult to find a path through the trees. Mary even tore her dress on sharp thorns. Suddenly, they saw some huts and lots of miniature people, cooking and making weapons with flint.
�I�ll ask them for help,� said Wilbur.
�No! Don�t go! They are deformed!� said Mary. �They�ll harass us! They may have a contagious virus that will make us sick! We won�t know how to cure it. We�ll surely end up as corpses!�
Wilbur tried to persuade Mary to go to the forest people, but she refused to integrate with them. She had the assumption that the small people were dangerous. �Let�s keep walking. We�re sure to find someone sooner or later.�
For three days, the couple searched, but they found no one who could help them in their crisis. It was uncomfortable, and they were hungry without any source of nutrition. Plus, the forest was filled with dangerous beasts. Finally, Mary agreed to return to the forest people.
When Wilbur and Mary arrived at the village, the forest people immediately welcomed them. They gave them bread made from barely to eat and a place to sleep. The next day, the forest people led Wilbur and Mary through the trees, and they promptly arrived at a small town. From there, they took a bus to the city where they found an embassy.
Mary was sorry that she had not trusted the forest people sooner. She learned the value of not discriminating against people who are different.

a Dying Forest
Rainforests provide much of the world�s oxygen supply. But the forests� exotic trees and animals are being killed to make room for farmers and roads. People have been trying to conserve rainforests for years. But another type of forest�the cloud forest�is just as beneficial to humans. Cloud forests are also in danger of disappearing, but little is being done to save them.
These forests are located at the tops of mountains, generally near the equator. These humid, wooded mountaintops are mainly in African and Central and South American countries. They are called �cloud forests� because their height allows for the formation of clouds among the trees.
Rainforests produce large amounts of oxygen. Cloud forests produce comparative amounts of water. The trees in these forests pull water out of the clouds. The moisture gathers on the leaves. When it drips, it is deposited into streams. The streams flow into towns at the bottom of the mountain. Then, it�s distributed to people. The yearly cumulative rainfall in these areas is 173-198 centimeters. Cloud forests can pull in up to 60 percent of that. This water is crucial to the plants and the people in the area. It helps them survive.
Cloud forests are also the birthplace of countless species of plants that can�t be found anywhere else. One small cloud forest has the capacity for as many types of plants as there are in all of Europe. There are so many, in fact, that scientists haven�t made a comprehensive list of them yet.
These forests are being destroyed with increasing frequency. Trees are being cut down, and roads are being built in their place. Some people have an objective to get federal money to protect the forests. But they have had little success. Another strategy is to replace the destroyed plants. That, too, has been difficult because the plants are so unique. There�s plenty of work to be done, but saving the cloud forests is still a possibility.

Thucydides and the Plague of Athens
Thucydides was the world�s first historian. Presently, we get most of our knowledge about ancient Greece from his writing. But Thucydides didn�t just write about history, he lived through it. However, he almost didn�t survive one historical event: the Plague of Athens.
In 430 BCE, an army attacked the city of Athens, where Thucydides lived. Thousands of people hid from the army behind Athens� large walls. The city became very crowded as the population expanded. Then a horrifying disease broke out. People summoned doctors. But it was to no avail because no one understood how the disease spread. It seemed random. They didn�t know that it was an organism. Instead, they defined disease as a punishment from their gods. Thucydides was incredulous that gods caused the plague, but he explained why others believed it. There was an old, long verse which predicted the disease. To paraphrase it, the verse said the gods would send a disease during a war. As a result, large crowds gathered at shrines to ask the gods to stop the plague. But the situation only worsened because these people were so close to each other they became sick. That�s how they learned a fundamental lesson about the plague: it spread from person to person.
People wanted to leave the crowded city, but they dreaded what the army outside would do to them. At this time, Thucydides got sick, too. He quickly scribbled down notes because he thought he would soon die. His writing shows a stark contrast between people�s behavior before and during the plague. There were riots, and people ignored laws. They didn�t think they�d live long enough to be punished. Many sick people were left to die in solitude because no one wanted to be near them. The plague lingered for two years. But luckily, Thucydides survived. Without his writing, we would know much less about ancient Greece and the Plague of Athens.

The Solar Car Race
We live in a mobile society. But the cars we drive require too much gas, plus they pollute the air. Eventually, the natural resources used to make gas will run out. So what happens then? Many people think solar-powered automobiles are the answer. To learn more about this type of transportation, teams from universities and corporate organizations gather in Australia every two years for a solar car race.
The race is called the World Solar Challenge. Candidates for this tournament must design their own cars. The teams keep all their plans confidential. They don�t interact with other teams because the race is very competitive. And these cars aren�t just enhanced and modified versions of normal cars. They are completely different.
The cars only have room for one person and are very simple inside�they don�t even have a cushion for the driver to sit on. These cars are shorter and much more flat than normal cars. Most importantly, the cars incorporate solar panels onto the outside that lie parallel to each other. These panels are made from materials that take in light from the sun and turn it into electric energy. That�s how they move.
These cars race over 3,000 kilometers across the Australian territories. The drivers have to heed strict guidelines. They must stop at certain intervals to charge their batteries. And unlike normal race cars, they can�t go very fast. They have to drive at the normal speed limits. Although the drivers want to finish the race quickly, that is not the main goal. The objective is to see how well the cars work under normal driving conditions.
Because of the World Solar Challenge, a new era in car making and in driving is beginning. People may ridicule the solar cars because they look strange, but this is a phenomenon that isn�t going away. Using the technology from the vehicles, car makers will eventually create solar cars for the rest of us.

The Heirs
Martin, Paul and Tom were brothers. They were very different, but they were consistent about two things. They couldn�t succeed in business, and they never agreed about anything. Martin was a hardworking farmer, growing organic vegetables and raising poultry. But he was disorganized and forgot to pay his bills. Paul owned a textile factory that produced clothes. He was organized, but he was greedy and took too much clothing. His wardrobe was filled with his own products. Tom was once a sergeant in the army. He ran a martial arts school, but his stance on discipline was too strong. He had almost no students.
One day, they received a telegraph saying that their father had died. They were heirs to his old farm. They planned to sell it as soon as possible, so they went to see it even though there was a terrible storm. The house didn�t look great, but there was a lot of land. There was so much, in fact, that they could barely see its boundary.
Suddenly, the storm got worse. The sheer force of the wind almost knocked them over. Martin said, �Look, it�s a typhoon!� Paul said, �No, it�s a cyclone.� Tom said, �No, it�s a tornado!� They argued until Paul began to wail and said, �Whatever it is, it�s coming right at us! We�re doomed!� The three brothers scrambled inside the old house. Martin said, �If we survive, we must stop fighting. This farm could be great if we fixed it up. With my hard work, Paul�s organization and Tom�s discipline, we could run a great business together!� The storm finally ended. And luckily, it didn�t wreck the farm.
�Just think,� Martin said, �it took the chaos of a typhoon to bring us together.� Paul replied, �You mean a cyclone brought us together.� Tom said, �Didn�t I tell you both that it was a tornado?� The brothers never agreed on what kind of storm it was, but by combining their skills, they started a successful farm.

The Little Mice
Beth was a very resourceful and conservative mouse. She knew that winter was coming and that there would soon be a dearth of food. So she decided to make gathering food for winter her primary job. Gathering food was a grueling and mundane activity, but Beth made a deliberate effort because she knew that it was important. She allotted herself a few hours every day to collect beans. By winter, she had collected a massive pile and hid them in a cache.
Beth had a sister named Mary. Mary lacked ambition. She had fanciful ideas about how she would survive winter. She thought that food would just come to her and that she could work at her own convenience. She opted to spend the days playing and dancing, instead of gathering beans. When the final hours of autumn elapsed, Mary had only a paltry amount of food stored away.
Mary realized that her food supply was too small to last through winter. She visited her sister. Mary said, �Beth, lamina dire situation. I didn�t gather enough food for winter. Will you let me share your beans? Please have some empathy for your sister!�
Beth thought for a moment. Then she replied, �Mary, I am truly sorry for you. But I will not give you any of my beans. Instead, I will let you have my empty bag. You can still work hard and gather enough food for the winter. It will be tedious, but you will learn the value of hard work.�
Beth�s words appalled Mary. Mary cried with outrage, �There is too much work! I won�t have any time to dance or play!�
Beth said, �It is crucial that you gather enough food. You must have sustenance before you have fun. Go now, and rectify your situation.�
Mary griped some more, but she knew that her sister was right. She took the bag and went to work gathering her own beans for the winter.

The Helpful Abbey
It had not rained on the prairie for several months. Because of the drought, the climate had become very arid. There was no moisture left in the soil. No crops could grow in the dry ground. By wintertime, the people had nothing to eat.
The hungry families heard about an abbey near the mountains where food and water was still abundant. So they traveled inland, across the prairie, to the abbey.
At first only a few families arrived, seeking food and shelter. Then there was ample food. The monks fed them and let them sleep in the small cathedral.
Soon, however, more families were arriving every day. These people had to travel farther, so they were in worse condition. The rugged journey had made their clothes ragged. They were cold and tired. The tiny cathedral was soon full.
Food became scarce. The monks began to grumble. They began to speculate that there would be no food. �If more families come, we won�t make it through the winter,� said a young monk. �We must ask some of them to leave.�
The abbot heard this. �We cannot do that,� he said. �It would be wrong to deprive them of food and shelter. We took an oath to help those that need help. All here are in need, so all are eligible to receive our food and shelter.�
�But we won�t have enough,� the monk said.
�That might be true, but we must help them nonetheless. We will fast,� the abbot replied. �Also, we will give our rooms in the abbey to those sleeping outside, and we will sleep in the churchyard that adjoins the cathedral.�
The monks were reluctant at first, but they did what the oldest monk said. By the end of winter, there was still enough food and shelter for everyone. They learned that sometimes helping others means you must give more help than you first expected.

The Bachelor�s Lesson
A keen young bachelor had finished his studies at the university. As soon as he had received his diploma, he asserted to everyone he met that he was the smartest person in town.
�I excel at everything I study,� he said, bragging about his knowledge. �I�ve mastered calculus and physiology. I even understand the great theoretical teachings of science, such as relativity. There is nothing that I don�t know. Whether it�s the movements of celestial objects, like planets and stars, or how to harness the power of radioactive substances, I know everything.�
But actually, there was something the bachelor did not know. Though his analytic abilities were great, he failed to notice he was missing something very important in his life.
One day while walking through town, the bachelor witnessed a collision between two cars. Both drivers appeared to be injured, but the scholar only stood and watched.
He thought to himself, �Those idiots should have been more alert. They really must not be very competent.� He never thought the drivers needed help.
�Please help me,� said the female driver in a weak voice. �Help me, too,� said the male driver. �I�m hurt and can�t move.�
Suddenly the bachelor realized he was the only person near the accident. He quit thinking and ran to help the drivers. He carefully helped them out of their vehicles and then called an ambulance.
The drivers were saved, and the bachelor felt the best he had in his entire life. Studying mythology, sociology, and geology didn�t give him this wonderful feeling. It was the act of helping others, not his cognitive skills, that gave him this great feeling.
He had learned an important lesson. He learned that intellect isn�t everything; being helpful is just as important. �Having only a brain is not enough,� he thought. �You must also have a heart.�

The Corrupt Administrator
Mr. Pig was an administrator at a big factory that made different kinds of merchandise. During a meeting at the company�s headquarters, his bosses said they wanted the factory to make more money.
�If the factory makes more money, then you will too,� his boss, Mr. Horse, told him. It was a great incentive. Pig had always wanted to be as affluent as his bosses.
Mr. Pig returned to the factory and started making changes. However, most were not very nice, and some were not legitimate.
First, he fired all his employees. Then he automated the entire factory. Machines now made everything, and the other animals, Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Sheep, and Mr. Dog had no jobs. Next, he bribed some corrupt senators into legislating special subsidies for the factory. Finally, instead of paying a company to dispose of the factory�s rubbish properly, he violated the law by throwing it into the river to save money.
At first, all the changes to the factory�s infrastructure created more revenue. But soon many stores could no longer sell the factory�s goods at retail. It seemed that the machines couldn�t make products as well as the workers. The customers were disappointed with the factory�s merchandise.
There were other problems, too. The animals had told their friends and family to stop buying the factory�s goods. Officials discovered the factory�s rubbish in the river, and when they audited the company, they discovered that Pig had manipulated the law in order to get more money.
All transactions with Pig�s factory stopped. The factory lost money, and Pig lost his job. He realized his mistakes too late. He had tried to become rich by saving money any way possible, but the cheapest way was not always the best.

A Famous Accident
One of the greatest pharmaceutical discoveries happened by accident. In his haste to go on vacation, Alexander Fleming had left his laboratory in a mess. The essence of his ongoing work involved a type of bacteria. An infection caused by the bacteria was often terminal, and he was looking for a remedy. He had left the bacteria out while he was away.
When he returned from vacation, he found that his lab was covered in fungus. He started cleaning up the mess. While he was cleaning, he had an impulse to examine the fungus. He saw that whenever the fungus was in close proximity to the bacteria, the bacteria died.
Though he was a messy scientist, his experiments were precise. He thought that there might be some significance to the fungus. He immediately commenced an experiment to assess what had happened to the bacteria. It had either died by accident or the fungus had killed it. The subsequent tests proved it was the latter reason.
What he found astonished him. The fungus actually killed the bad bacteria. All this time, he had been looking for a synthetic material to kill the bacteria. Instead, a common fungus did the job.
He knew that something in the fungus had killed the bacteria. His next step was to find those molecules that had done it. When he found them, he extracted them and put them into a pill. The drug proved to be very effective. It also worked against other types of harmful bacteria.
The discovery received a lot of publicity. Soon after, the new drug was being used all over the world. Because of the success, the scientist was able to develop even more fabulous drugs to help people. His accidental discovery changed the world and helped save many people�s lives.

The Island
�Where am I?� Bob thought to himself when he woke up on a peculiar beach. �I can�t remember what happened.� There had been a bad storm, and Bob�s fishing boat sunk. He washed ashore on a small island, but he had gotten hurt during the storm. He had a terrible migraine, and he had a fracture in his shoulder. He felt awful. But he had a strong desire to make it home to his spouse and children. He had to tolerate all the pain and devise a plan.
Bob stood up and looked around. �I�ll walk to a higher altitude, so I can see everything around me,� thought Bob. �Maybe I�ll gain some insight about this island and find something to help me escape.� As he walked along a mountain ridge, he noticed that the tall indigenous trees looked sturdy and thick. Bob got a brilliant idea. He could build a raft! He cut down some leaves and tree limbs. Even though his shoulder injury impaired his ability to carry the materials, he slowly dragged them down the mountain until he reached the coastline.
Bob was a proficient builder. He used his building expertise to line up the limbs and tie them together with long vines. When the raft was finished, Bob was happy with his work. �This will bring me home to my family,� he said with a smile.
At last, Bob was ready to implement his escape plan. With all his might, he thrust the raft into the water. He climbed on and began the quest to find his way home. Bob smiled again, and thought, �I�m glad I kept a good attitude. It prevented the pain from deterring me from my plan. Optimism and ambition make anything possible.� Slowly, he floated out to sea. In a few days, he made it to shore and ran home to see his happy family.

Small World
Even though people can�t see me, I�m an important part of Earth�s biosphere. Scientists who study ecology know that I was the first life form on Earth. There is more of my kind than any other plant or animal in the world. Without me, other plants and animals would not even exist, lama protist, and my tiny body is made up of one single cell.
In my small world, things can be absolutely bizarre. Unlike most aquatic plants and animals, I don�t need a temperate climate. I have a very high tolerance for extreme conditions. Right now, I�m swimming around in a bucket of boiling water! The temperature is 150 degrees Celsius, but I feel comfortable. I have coarse hairs called cilia that help me swim around in here. I move my cilia in a repetitive motion for the duration of my swim. I cannot go very fast, though. It takes me about five minutes to swim a distance of just one millimeter!
When I get hungry, I look for tiny, vulnerable parasites. I swim up to one and swallow it whole. I digest things much like people do. I have an organ that works just like a human stomach. After I eat, I release nitrogen gas. Nitrogen is a prominent gas in the earth�s atmosphere. Other plants and animals need my nitrogen to survive.
My reproductive ability is my most unique trait. I don�t need a companion to mate with. Instead, I undergo a process called fission, where my own nucleus splits in half. An exact copy of my nucleus is made, which forms into another protist. It really is an impressive feat. I can create an infinite number of new protists all by myself!

Becoming a Healer
Years ago, I worked at a small health clinic in a remote country. I had gone there to treat an obscure syndrome. It attacked people�s lungs, causing them to need a respirator to breathe. I was trying out a new medication to treat these people instead of using a respirator. If I was successful, I would become famous.
Everything was going fine until war broke out in a nearby country. Many people from that country fled the hostile invading army. The army wanted to dominate the people, but the people didn�t want to be oppressed. So they walked hundreds of miles across barren land to get away.
Some of these people came to our clinic for treatment. I talked with them and learned of their difficulties. They did not beg or complain. I was impressed by their dignity.
There was one woman I will never forget. Her son suffered from malnutrition and stomach pain, and she didn�t know what to do. Neither did I.I was not adept at treating malnutrition. Nonetheless, when I saw her sadness, I knew I had to help her son.
The woman had been feeding her son bread and water. She had a misconception that it would be enough for him. However, I knew that he needed to eat vegetables, too. So I took her outside and showed her a dense patch of edible plants. I taught her how to dig up the roots, peel them, and cook them for her son. I explained that she should increase her son�s intake of these vegetables. Likewise, she should strive to get him some meat once a week to help him regain his strength.
I sent her off with a prescription for some pain medicine, but she also left my office with some new culinary skills. A few weeks later, she returned to tell me her son was healthy again. As thanks, she gave me a beautiful ceramic bowl.
I never become famous, but I kept that bowl to remind me what it truly means to heal someone.

The Weaving Machine
Mr. Joseph Franklin invented a machine that could weave cloth. It wove faster and straighter than anyone could weave by hand. He decided to take it to two cities on a peninsula, Netherton and Wilton. In these cities, a large proportion of the people worked in weaving. Joseph felt sure he could sell his machine there.
Joseph first took his machine to the mayor of Netherton. �Think of the money you will earn from this machine!� Joseph said to him.
But the mayor was a benevolent man. He knew about the people�s dependence on weaving for their livelihood. If he bought the machine, the people would lose their jobs. So he refused to buy it.
Joseph said, �We are no longer in the medieval age! Soon everything will be made by machines. Cloth made by hand will soon be obsolete. If you don�t change your archaic ways, your town�s income will diminish!�
But the mayor said, �I don�t like capitalism. Don�t impose your radical ideas on my town. Go away!�
So Joseph took his machine to the mayor at Wilton. This mayor thought Joseph�s machine was spectacular and spent a long time looking at its different components made of brass. The mayor couldn�t refute the fact that the machine had drawbacks that would affect the people�s jobs. But he realized the machine could bring money and prestige. So he ordered Joseph to build twenty of them.
Within a year, Wilton was a wealthy city, famous for its wonderful cloth. People no longer wove but worked in managerial jobs at cloth factories instead. Nobody bought the cloth from Netherton anymore. The people of Netherton became poor and hungry.
Finally, the mayor of Netherton called Joseph and said, �Now I realize that your machine is not just a passing fad. To succeed in business, we must be willing to change.� He then ordered twenty weaving machines.
After that, both Netherton and Wilton became rich cities, famous throughout the land for their wonderful cloth.

Life on the Farm
Bill was an excellent capitalist. He financed a large aviation enterprise that made a lot of money. He knew how to maximize monetary gains in every business deal he made. Bill had one big problem, though. He was unhappy all the time. Bill knew that he had to do something about it, or he would be depressed for the rest of his life.
One day, Bill was in his office when he heard a knock at the door. �Come in!� Bill said loudly.
His accountant, Jane, walked in. Jane said, �Sir, I haven�t seen you smile in a year. What are you so sad about? Your company is doing very well.�
Bill told her, �I�m indifferent about my company�s success. I have contempt toward my job. I just want to do something I enjoy. I�ve always loved growing plants as a hobby. I�m going to quit my job and become a farmer!�
�You�re crazy!� Jane said.
�I don�t think so,� Bill replied. �I want the simplicity of a life on a farm. I�m tired of all this stress. Farming will make me happy.�
The very next day, Bill carried out the preliminary task of buying land and tools. Then he got to work. He sowed many types of seeds. He planted soy, cabbage, carrots, and onions.
�The upcoming summer is going to be very dry,� thought Bill. �I need to irrigate my crops as a precaution, in case it doesn�t rain enough.� He took his spade and dug a ditch down the middle of his farm. �Water from the stream will flow down the ditch and saturate the soil around every plant,� Bill thought.
Bill dedicated himself to farming. After a year, his farm looked exquisite. Most importantly, Bill was happy. He finally had the life he always wanted.

Beethoven�s Gift
Beethoven was a great composer of classical music in the 1800s. Many biographies have been written that narrate his dominance in the music world. But do you know what really makes him special? Even though millions of people got to hear his multiple masterpieces, he never did. Beethoven wrote his best pieces after he went completely deaf!
His partiality toward classical music developed when he was very young. He wasn�t interested in anything else as a child. When he was five, he learned how to play the piano. From then, nothing could stop his passion for writing and playing music.
When Beethoven was twenty, he began to lose his hearing. He got acute, spontaneous pains in his ears. His hearing kept getting worse over time. It was inevitable that he would eventually lose it altogether. It was very hard for him to keep writing music. He lost the virtue of patience, and he became notorious for his aggression. Still, he never stopped trying. His passion for music compelled him to keep performing even after he went deaf. He couldn�t hear himself play, but he knew that his creations sounded gorgeous.
His final concert was held at a huge banquet. He gave the musicians a cue, and they began to play. He directed the concert with all his heart. He couldn�t hear the music, but he said that he could feel it. Overall, performance was one of the finest in history. When it was over, he turned to the crowd. They clapped and cheered wildly. In that beautiful moment, the applause boosted his emotions, and he began to cry.
In 1827, he suffered from lead poisoning. He didn�t survive the sickness, but his music did because great music never becomes outdated. Even though Beethoven is gone, his legacy will live on forever.

Brothers
John and Mark were brothers, but they were quite different people. Mark looked very masculine. He had a mustache and was very muscular. He was a sculptor. He made things out of stone. Mark was a good artist, but he was not very intelligent.
John looked nothing like his brother. He was small and weak, but he was very smart. John was an undergraduate in college, and he studied anthropology and history. He knew a lot about ancient cultures. The brothers loved each other very much, but they thought they had nothing in common.
One day, the mayor appointed Mark to build a monument: a statue of Egyptian Pharaoh, Tut. Mark agreed to do the job, but he had a problem. He had no idea who Pharaoh Tut was! However, he thought he had the competence to build a good statue anyway. He made some crude measurements and sculpted a statue of a very old man with a tattoo on his chest. Mark was proud of his work, but when John saw the statue, he laughed aloud.
�What�s so funny?� Mark asked.
John replied, �Your ignorance makes me laugh. Don�t you know that Tut was only a teenager when he was pharaoh? Let me help you. I�ll supervise your work. I�ll give you feedback, and we�ll make this a great monument.�
Mark got another cube of stone. John told him what Tut looked like. �Make him tall with good posture,� John said. �And make sure there is symmetry in his body.�
Mark conferred with John about every detail. For ten consecutive hours, the brothers worked. At last, the finished statue was situated in front of the museum. Everyone applauded the brothers� good work.
�We worked together very well. I guess we are compatible after all,� Mark said.
John replied, �I agree! When we combine our talents, we are capable of greatness.�

The Old Hound
Elvis was a dog that loved to run. He possessed all the criteria to be a great racing dog. He had long legs, lean muscles, and a strong heart. He was so good that he never lost a race in the northern hemisphere. Spectators who bet on dog races always picked Elvis to win.
After ten years of racing, however, Elvis was getting old. His faculties were not as strong as they used to be. His owner got upset when Elvis started losing. Elvis�s owner wasn�t a considerate person. He degraded the dog all the time. Finally, his owner decided to get rid of him. He threw Elvis in his car and took him to the middle of the forest. He tossed him out and drove away. Elvis was cold and scared. He decided to follow a brook into the city.
Elvis soon found out that the city was a big and impersonal place. Everywhere he went, he saw signs that said, �No Dogs Allowed.� Pedestrians yelled at him. He was sad, hungry,  and alone. He thought that all people were as cruel and uncaring as his owner had been. He  was ready to give up when he heard a soft voice say, �What a beautiful hound!� Elvis looked up and saw an old woman. She said, �You�re entitled to a better life than this. I can take you to a sanctuary for old dogs like you. I�ll cater to all your needs. Would you like to come with me?�
The woman escorted Elvis to a beautiful facility. There was a sign on the external door that said, �Dogs Welcome!� The interior of the building was painted blue, and shiny ornaments hung from the ceiling. There was a heap of tasty bones and bread crusts for consumption.
Elvis learned there were kind people in the world after all. He was so thankful that he jumped up and licked the woman's face.

Day Without Sight
On Friday afternoon, Sam�s teacher had a special assignment.
�Next week, we�ll be studying humanitarian efforts around the world since the time of the Renaissance, including those to help the blind,� she said. �Over the weekend, I want each of you to wear a blindfold for an entire day. The premise of this experiment is that it will help you understand what it�s like to be blind,� she said.
Sam was a skeptic. He really didn�t think the assignment would be too challenging. On Saturday morning, Sam took a piece of cloth and tied it around his head to cover his eyes. Then he went into the kitchen for breakfast. He heard the voices of his parents and brothers but couldn�t specify where each voice was coming from. He thought about how important hearing is for blind people.
�Could you pass me the newspaper, please?� he asked. Just then, he remembered he couldn�t see the words on the page. He wondered if Braille newspapers were ever made.
After finishing breakfast, his brothers asked him to play soccer. As he followed them, he accidentally walked into the baker�s rack. He also found that he couldn�t play soccer. He wouldn�t be able to coordinate his actions without being able to see. Without his optic senses, he had no spatial awareness. Furthermore, he couldn�t do simultaneous activities because he had to make sure he was safe first.
He sat on the lawn. Suddenly, he realized that though he couldn�t see, his other senses worked perfectly fine. In fact, he began to realize new and different aspects of common objects. For example, he took a flower bud and felt it with his finger. He realized for the first time that it seemed to be covered with wax.
His hypothesis about being blind was disproved. The informative experiment had an imprint on him. It showed him sight was an asset that should be appreciated and taught him to revere the talents of blind people.

The Big Ship
Ernest looked at his fleet of ships. Usually, he used them for his firm, which imported marble statues from other countries. But today he was going fishing. And the ship he chose was his favorite. It had an elaborate painting on the side that showed a naval battle. It also had some new updates to its computer system. His favorite ship�s latest acquisition was a device with a small grid to show the ship�s exact location. This new accessory kept Ernest from getting lost.
At daybreak, Ernest happily sailed the temperate waters until he was far from land. Then he saw a small boat in the distance. There was an old man standing next to its mast. He was waving his arms in the air. There was also a boy with his head hanging over the boat�s edge. Ernest inferred that the boy was suffering from nausea. Both of their clothes were saturated with sea water. Ernest assumed that they were in trouble. Most people never realized, but Ernest had an innate desire to help people. He began sailing toward them, eager to facilitate their rescue and thus solve their dilemma.
As he got closer to the boat, he was shocked by its simplicity. The boat�s wood looked no stronger than cardboard, and the equipment was old. Still, there were several large fish in a pouch in the boat.
Ernest threw a large package onto the boat. He yelled, �Here! You can inflate this boat to get you back to land.�
�Get out of here!� screamed the old man.
Ernest was confused. �Don�t you need help?� he asked. �Your ship doesn�t seem adequate enough to sail so far away from land.�
�You�ve just scared away a huge fish,� the boy said. �We waved to let you know you were too close to us.�
Ernest turned around and headed home. He learned that it�s better not to help unless asked to. Otherwise, you might not help anyone at all.

The History of Parachutes
Scientists who study archeology say that there may be some evidence of prehistoric parachutes. But the first written history of the device comes from China about 2,100 years ago. Scientists cite an ancient book that describes parachutes. However, there is no archeological evidence that proves that an actual parachute was ever made. Later, people from northern Africa and Italy also had ideas about a similar invention. In fact, a Leonardo Da Vinci�s drawing corresponds closely with the modern parachute design!
In 1783, French scientist Sebastian Lenormand invented the first modern parachute. Sebastian brainstormed with other scientists to come up with a way to help people jump safely out of burning buildings. He thought the solution was to give people an object to restrict their speed while they traveled toward the ground. Many people thought that he was up to some kind of fraud, but Sebastian had a lot of integrity. His budget was limited, so he first tested his theory by using two umbrellas. He jumped out of a tree and found that the umbrellas worked.
Next, he refined his invention. Rather than using umbrellas, he knit a large parachute. Finally, he jumped off a tall building on a French estate and landed safely in the courtyard.
Sebastian�s work gave another man an idea. Jean-Pierre Blanchard had a different outlook than Sebastian. He was a hot air balloon addict. He was one of the first people to ride in a hot air balloon powered by hydrogen gas. He was a proponent of using the parachutes to exit from hot air balloons. Starting in 1785, he used his dog to show that animals could land safely from hot air balloons by using parachutes. Then, in 1793, he was faced with a chaotic experience. The hot air balloon he was riding in burst and started to fall. He was forced to use a parachute himself. And much to his relief, it saved his life!

�I Didn�t Do It!�
Billy was in big trouble. The day before, a donor gave the school a painting with a sports theme. It showed a referee congratulating two athletes. The principal hung the painting in front of the office, hoping that it would be a stimulus for students to play sports. The next morning, however, the painting was destroyed. There was graffiti on it, and it had many holes in it. The worst part was that one of Billy�s fellow students said she thought she saw Billy do it!
But Billy didn�t do it. The principal called Billy�s parents and said, �Billy won�t tell us the truth. He�s a chronic liar, and he ruined the painting. If you don�t pay for it, we�ll terminate his education here.�
Billy�s parents didn�t have enough money to pay for the painting and for his tuition. But Billy�s parents had an idea. That afternoon, they went to see Mr. Meyers, an attorney.
�Mr. Meyers, my son has been implicated in a crime he says he didn�t do,� Billy�s father said. �Everybody believes the gossip. Even some of our own kin think he did it!�
�I believe you. My suspicion is that the tape from the security cameras will show who really did it,� said Mr. Meyers.
The next day, Mr. Meyers received a packet with the videotape from the school. It showed another student who resembled Billy walking up to the painting and writing on it. Then the student took a knife by the shaft and started to stab large holes in it. Finally, he severed the rope that held up the painting, and it fell to the floor.
Mr. Meyers showed the tape to the principal. �Clearly, that�s not Billy,� he said. �This boy is actually responsible and needs some discipline.�
Billy was happy that someone believed him. He said to Mr. Meyers, �When I graduate and go to university, I will major in law, so I can be a guardian of justice like you!�

The Soldier�s Decision
A soldier was captured while fighting in an enemy king�s land. It was well known that this king would make captives fight one another. This was commonplace during his reign. For these fights, the king had built several large arenas. He often awarded the winners by setting them free or even having them join his elite army corps.
The soldier, however, decided he had seen too much violence. He now felt that all life was sacred. The night before his first match, he made a risky decision. He decided that he would not engage in combat. He knew he may never be set free, but it was a decision that he was willing to accept.
In the morning, he was led from the prisoners� compound to one of the king�s arenas. A gate coated in rust stood between him and the auditorium�s floor. He was worried, but he knew what he had to do.
When the gate opened, he calmly walked to the center of the arena and sat. He started to meditate. His foe Darius, who was skilled in the realm of sword fighting and was typically not very aggressive, would not fight the quiet soldier until he attacked Darius first.
Darius tried to provoke him by hacking at the air close to his head with his sword. But the soldier was not distracted. He sat quietly, as if he were dumb, and looked calmly up at the sky. Even when Darius nicked him on the cheek with the edge of his sword, the soldier did not move.
At last he threw down his sword and shield and gave up. �I can�t fight someone who refuses to fight me!� Darius shouted to the king.
The king was very impressed with the soldier. Never in any battle had he seen someone so brave. As a result, he gave the peaceful soldier amnesty. The soldier�s actions proved to the king and everyone in the arena that peace was more powerful than fighting.

Jane�s Pride
Jane and her father, Mike, owned a secondhand boat. They called it �High Hopes.� The two loved to spend time together on the ocean and would often go on long fishing trips.
Mike taught Jane how to perform important tasks. Jane learned how to steer the boat and adjust the sails. She learned how to put grease on the intricate gears of the motor. She learned how to submerge the anchor and secure it by putting a rope in a slot. Jane liked helping her father, but she thought that she wasn�t very good at it. Sometimes, she omitted important steps and made frequent mistakes. Jane thought she wasn�t capable of manual labor.
Mike wanted to prove to her that she was indeed capable and important. He thought of a tactic to test Jane�s skills in the context of a catastrophe. He hid under the deck and pretended to be trapped. He shouted, �Jane, I can�t get out! You have to get back to the dock and find help!�
Jane began to panic. She thought she might make her usual mistakes, which would precipitate a disaster. However, she had to listen to her dad and act accordingly. She pulled up the anchor with all of her might. She remembered to overlap the sails to offset the wind. She steered the boat around buoys where the water was shallow. When they got to shore, Mike came out from under the deck.
Jane said, �I thought you were trapped!�
Mike laughed. He said, �It wasn�t a genuine emergency. I distorted the truth to test your abilities. Look at what a great job you did getting the boat home safely! I knew you could do it.�
To honor his daughter, Mike decided to rename his boat. He designated it �Jane�s Pride� and painted the name on the fore of the ship. Jane finally had something to be proud of.

Microchips
The bond between humans and computers is becoming more intimate than ever before. Scientists are now putting microchips inside people�s bodies. They are made up of compressed electrical circuits that can detect and record data about the body. They are tiny, but they hold the equivalent amount of data as most computers.
A microchip is put to use inside a person with a simple procedure. First, a doctor must put data about the patient onto a chip. Input about the person�s age, race, gender, and medical history is stored on the chip. The second phase of the process involves putting it in the person�s skin. The doctor pinches a piece of skin and cuts a tiny hole with a tool shaped like a spiral. The chip is inserted, and the skin is allowed to heal. At last, it begins the task of putting data into its database.
Microchips scan the patient�s body to record what is happening on the quantum level. They can find problems with the person�s metabolism and organs. They can also detect viral infections. They can find the aggregate number of immune and infected cells and present the results in a ratio. They can even tell doctors what type of antibiotic to give to the patient!
To recover the chip�s data, the doctor uses a special magnet that copies it. This way, the doctor can put the information from the chip onto a computer. Then they can find out exactly what is wrong with the person.
The idea of putting chips in humans is still very new. However, it is now becoming more prevalent. Scientists and doctors are hopeful about the future uses of microchips. Someday, all new babies might get a microchip soon after they are born. Doctors will be able to know about any problems from the very beginning. It is obvious that medicine and computers complement each other well.

The Twins
Katie and Alice were twins. They were so alike that few people could tell the siblings apart. They were almost like clones. They even used the same colloquial language as each other. They were best friends.
But the twins� attributes were not all identical. Alice liked humanities, and Katie was a good linguist. One summer, Katie decided to be a participant at a summer camp in France. Alice wasn�t interested in the French language, so she didn�t go. But she felt angry that Katie wanted to spend the summer away from her.
Two months later, Katie returned. Alice dashed to the airport to greet her sister. But when Alice saw Katie, she was astounded. Katie was now bilingual, and she looked completely different! She was wearing nice clothes, cosmetics and looked skinnier. Alice felt very messy next to her. She was just wearing a fluorescent t-shirt, and her hair had knots in it.
When Alice asked Katie about France, Katie was vague and didn�t say much. It made Alice furious and filled her with disgust because in the past they�d always told each other everything. Now there was a huge gulf between them. Over the weeks, the sisters spoke even less.
Two months later, it was the twins� birthday. All their lives, they�d had a ritual. Before their birthday, they�d talk all night long. That night, Alice came into Katie�s bedroom.
�I�m sorry I haven�t spoken much lately,� Katie said.
�I understand. You have new friends now,� said Alice, angrily.
Katie said, �My French friends don�t write much nowadays. For a while, I thought they were more exciting than my friends at home. But I was wrong. You�re my sister, and you�ll always be my best friend.�
Alice said, �I�m sorry, too. I wanted our relationship to stay the same forever. But it�s totally plausible for twins to have different interests. We can still be best friends without being together all the time.�

The New Bioco
Jack got a new job at a biotechnology company called Bioco. Bioco manufactured drugs to treat diabetes and high cholesterol. Jack�s job was to use a tiny mechanism to get nectar from flowers. The nectar was a main ingredient in the drugs. Jack liked his job, and he thought that Bioco was a caring company. However, Jack soon learned that the company wasn�t as kind as he first thought.
Bioco�s motto was �Make the Earth a Better Place.� However, this motto was deceptive. The company actually did a number of really bad things to the environment. The company produced a lot of smog and harmful acid. Bioco poured the acid in a nearby river, which caused erosion and made fish prone to illness.
After a few weeks at the new job, Jack saw all the bad things Bioco was doing. He had always had strong ethics, and he knew he had to do something. One day, while the Bioco workers were eating in the cafeteria, Jack stood up and gave a speech. He said, �My fellow coworkers, I know you have all seen the evil things our company is doing. I have a notion that we can fix them if we form a coalition. We can go to the administration and tell them we�ll quit if they don�t eliminate the problems. They�ll have no choice but to listen to us.�
Jack explained what they were to do. His coworkers liked his explicit plan. They went to the administrative offices and demanded that Bioco stop damaging the environment, or they all would quit. One supervisor said to them, �Thank you for being straightforward about this issue. Since I can�t afford to lose all of you workers, I guess we�ll just have to fix things.�
Jack, his supervisor, and his coworkers spent the next month designing a new framework for the company. They cleaned up the acid from the river and minimized the amount of air pollution the company released. At last, the company motto became apt.

How Comet Got His Tail
A solitary rock roamed through the cold gloom of outer space. It slowly drifted through the debris of broken asteroids with a feeling of sadness. In the vast and beautiful galaxy, it was only a tiny rock. It felt like an insignificant atom.
In its journeys it encountered many amazing objects. It flew by beautiful crescent moons that were covered with craters and moon dust.
�Why can�t I be as beautiful as them?� it thought.
The rock passed a gigantic planet. The sphere had a circumference hundreds of times larger than the breadth of the small rock.
�Why can�t I be as large as that?� it wondered.
The rock was filled with despair. It was surrounded by beauty and greatness, yet it was just a small and ugly fragment of rock.
One day, it approached the area of an astronomical star.
�What�s wrong?� the star asked.
�Oh, I wish I had a higher status in the galaxy. All the other objects are so beautiful and large,� the rock replied. �But I�m just an ugly rock.�
The star considered the problem. At last it said, �You don�t have to worry anymore. I think I can help.� The star radiated its light brighter and hotter than it had ever done before. �Come a little closer,� the star said to the rock.
The rock drifted closer to the star. Suddenly, the ice that was embedded in the rock�s tiny cracks melted and became steam. Then the steam extended behind the comet to form a brilliant tail. The tail shined with all the colors of the spectrum.
The little rock had become a beautiful comet. It looked so amazing. It realized that the star helped it change its appearance. �Thank you,� the comet said and then flew away with its new beautiful tail following behind it like a galactic cape.

The Resourceful Landlord
A kind landlord was afraid that he would lose his apartment building. He needed to make some mandatory repairs to the old building, or his tenants would have to leave by the end of the month. Without tenants to lease the rooms, the landlord would be unable to pay his mortgage. He�d be bankrupt, and the bank would take his building.
But he didn�t have the money whereby he could employ the personnel needed to make the repairs. It would seem like he did not want to conform to the city�s codes before the forthcoming inspection. He had requested an extension, but it was denied by the city.
He held a meeting with his tenants and explained the unfortunate situation. �If the building does not meet the appropriate standards for safety and hygiene,� he said, �the city will expel everyone.�
The tenants were all sad for the kind old man.
�Maybe we can help,� the hairdresser who lived on the first floor stated. The other tenants agreed.
One tenant had worked for the city�s utilities. He knew a lot about plumbing, so that�s how he helped. Another tenant was a carpenter; he mended the holes in the floor and walls. Others cleaned the building from top to bottom so that it was more hygienic. They even furnished some of the apartments with new beds, dressers, and chairs. When they were done, all of the people dispersed, and the landlord went home to rest.
When the deadline of the inspection arrived, the apartment building was hygienic and safe. The landlord couldn�t believe it. His old building now looked like one of the trendiest buildings in town. The building passed its inspection, and the landlord and the tenants had a big party.
�Thank you all so much,� the landlord said during the party. �I could never have done it by myself. But by working together, we now all have a beautiful place to live.�

The Man and the Monkey
While flying over a jungle, a wealthy executive�s private plane crashed. Some of the crew were hurt, so the pilot decided to stay with them and wait for help. The arrogant executive, though, didn�t care about the welfare of the pilot and crew. Rather, he thought he could walkout of the jungle and find a town to stay in.
He followed a trail through a canyon and along a creek. The jungle was actually very stunning. If the arrogant executive had stopped to look around, he might have perceived the jungle�s beauty. But he was in a nasty mood and had no care for the aesthetic value of the jungle. He continued to walk up the steep incline of the jungle�s hills.
Soon, he was lost. Several days passed, and fatigue and hunger weakened him. He was very tired and afraid.
Just then, a monkey came out of the trees. It was carrying a twig covered in honey. It walked up to a mound where termites lived. He then used the twig like a drill to make a hole in the mound. Then very carefully, it removed the twig from the hole. The sticky twig was covered with termites.
Instead of eating the bugs, the monkey offered them to the executive, but he didn�t want what the monkey offered. He shouted at the monkey, �Get away from me, you stupid primate!�
The executive�s stereotype of the monkey was wrong. The monkey was not stupid. It knew how to find food, whereas the executive did not. He refused the help of the monkey, thereby leaving himself to starve.
When the executive was finally found, he was very skinny and sick. He had not eaten for a very longtime. Because he held a bias against the primitive ways of the monkey, he had gone hungry and almost died. The executive didn�t understand that it was his arrogant attitude that had caused all of his problems.

Cosmo�s Flight
When Cosmo woke up, he was crying. He had a dream that he was falling. This dream had recurred for the previous five nights. Cosmo was scared that his dreams were a preview of what was going to happen on his flight the next day.
Cosmo was a supernatural being who was about to turn 15 years old. In his culture, boys of his age were required to participate in an important rite. They were given wings and instructed to orbit the Earth. After successful flights, the boys officially became men. Cosmo certainly wanted to be a man, but he was scared. He went to the oracle of a god named Dano. Cosmo said, �I�m not sure I can make such a long trip. What if I get tired? What if my strength stalls, and I can�t stay in the air. I�ll crash and die!�
Dano replied, �Don�t be afraid. You have all the relevant skills in your personal inventory that have been building up over the years. To ease your worry, let me tell you a little about what will happen tomorrow. You�ll begin over Africa. You�ll keep flying north until you come to the Himalayas. The mountaintops will look like small loaves of bread at such a high distance. The rivers of the world will look like pieces of blue string that cross the globe. Keep your body horizontal when flying against the winds of the Pacific Ocean. Keep your eyes open and enjoy the beauty of the Earth. You will be fine, you�ll see.�
Cosmo replied, �Thanks for the overview of my journey, I�ll do my best.�
The next morning, Cosmo was provided with a divine set of wings and sent on his way. He flapped his wings and went high above the Earth. He flew over mountains, oceans, and glaciers. After a while, his inward thoughts were no longer about falling. He was actually having fun! He began to hum a song as he enjoyed the view. When he reached home, his tribe was there to greet him.
The chief said, �On behalf of the tribe, I declare you a man. We�re proud of you, Cosmo!�
Cosmo was proud of himself, too.

The First Organ Transplant
In 1954, a man named Richard was dying of kidney disease. He wouldn�t survive for long unless he got a new kidney right away. Richard�s twin brother, Robert, was willing to donate one of his kidneys to his dying brother. At the time, however, no doctor had ever performed a successful internal organ transplant. The idea of taking an organ out of one person and putting it into another was just a fantasy. But the brothers decided to be brave and found a doctor who could make organ transplants a reality.
Since Richard and Robert were twins, their heredity was identical. They had the exact same biological traits. Even their kidneys were identical on the cellular level. Therefore, Robert�s working kidney could be substituted for Richard�s bad one. Richard�s body could adapt to the new organ if the operation was done correctly.
The twins went to Dr. Murray, who was a pioneer of new surgical methods. His dynamic team of surgeons performed the transplant. Dr. Murray made sure his surgeons followed a rigid sequence of directions so that no mistakes were made. First, they made a minimal cut in Richard�s side and removed the bad kidney. Then, they made another small cut in Robert�s side, removed his kidney, and transferred it into Richard�s body. Finally, they sewed up the respective cuts. The entire operation only took about one hour.
After the surgery, it was clear that both brothers were going to be OK. The operation was confirmed a success. Richard�s new kidney worked great! Doctors prescribed medicine for the pain caused by the surgery. Since Richard was still weak, he used physical therapy to revive his strength. At last, Richard�s transition into a healthy, happy person was complete.
Dr. Murray became a hero in the medical world. His success gave other doctors confidence to try organ transplants themselves. Now, doctors perform life-saving transplants and surgeries every day.

The Lottery
Joe was watching television when he heard a knock at the door. He thought, �Who could that be? It�s probably one of the naughty neighborhood children.� Joe stood up and walked to the door. When he opened it, he saw a beautiful woman.
She said, �Good morning, Joe! I have great news. You�re the recipient of this check for one million dollars! You won the lottery!�
Joe couldn�t believe it. His mind was overloaded with emotions. Joe said, �Thankyou! Thank you!�
After he calmed down, Joe made a photocopy of the check in case he misplaced the original one. He sat and thought about what he wanted to do with the money. He didn�t want to spend it in an arbitrary way. Joe thought, �I know there are others who need this money more than I do. I�ve always loved animals, so I think I�ll buy things for the zoo!�
Joe knew that the zoo was in bad shape. The cages were too small, and they weren�t insulated from the cold. Animals couldn�t thrive in such conditions.
He took out some stationery and wrote a letter to the zoo. He offered to help the zoo buy huge cages for the large mammals and reptiles. He offered to buy healthy food for the orangutans to increase their longevity. He even said that he would buy new glass walls for the aquarium because the old ones were cracked.
Joe�s act of philanthropy intrigued the zookeeper. He probed Joe to learn why he spent his money to improve the zoo. It wasn�t a social convention for a person to be so gracious.
Joe told the zookeeper, �I know it�s not the norm, but my ultimate decision to help I these animals is better than anything I could have done for myself. If I ever write an autobiography, I will write that this was the happiest day of my life.�

Jen�s New Job
The history museum needed to recruit a new tour guide. The director interviewed dozens of applicants before he decided to hire Jen. She was chosen because she was friendly, punctual and had a great attitude.
On her first day, Jen got to work and prepared to give her first tour. She looked at the names on the register. She saw that the Queen of England and a diplomat were visiting the museum. She thought, �It�s my very first day, and I have to impress a monarch! I hope I don�t humiliate myself in front of a person of such renown!�
Jen was nervous. She took a deep breath and said, �Hello, everyone! I�m going to talk to you about the chronology of ancient Egypt.� As she turned around to show the group some artifacts, she bumped into a fossil of an authentic elephant tusk. It fell to the ground and broke into a million pieces! �Oh no!� said Jen in a subtle voice. �I sure hope the rest of the tour goes better than this!�
The rest of the tour did not go any better. She tripped over an antique vase and broke a piece off of it. As she was reading an excerpt from a lyric poem, she sneezed and tore a page of the epic.
After the tour, Jen approached the queen to apologize. She said, �I�m sorry, Your Majesty. I was a terrible tour guide. Let me give you a refund for the money you spent.�
The queen laughed. She said, �I don�t want my money back, Jen. I loved the tour. You just have to be a little more careful and work hard to become the best at your job. Hard work precedes success.�
Jen smiled and thanked the queen. She decided to be extra careful from then on. She was persistent and worked hard. In time, Jen became the best tour guide at the museum.

The Demon�s Bridge
A young woman�s cow had crossed the river in the morning when the water level was moderate. But when the woman returned with her dog to get the cow, she was overwhelmed by how high the water had risen. Even if she crossed, she still couldn�t tow her cow back through the river.
�What am I going to do?� she wondered.
Suddenly, a man appeared across the river. �A fragile young lady like you shouldn�t have to struggle across a river,� he said. �I�ll build you a bridge.�
The man was an enigma. The young woman�s perception of him was that he was a sociable person. He was talkative, yet something was strange about him.
�I don�t want to be a burden to you, sir,� the woman replied.
�Don�t worry,� he told her as he began crafting a bridge. He merged the pieces of the bridge together with amazing speed. Soon, it was finished.
�Oh, but how can I pay you for your work? Let�s compromise. I am sure that we can find a fair solution. What do you think?� The woman asked.
�The only currency I need is the first living thing that crosses the bridge,� the man replied.
She thought, �This deal sounds weird. Maybe he�s actually a river demon.� She shivered because she realized that he had taken advantage of her innocence and rigged the deal somehow. But she had a plan of her own. She pulled a piece of bread from her pocket and threw it across the bridge. Her dog ran after it.
�The dog is the first living thing across the bridge,� she said to the man.
The man was angry. He suddenly changed into a hybrid of a human and a fish. �You crook!� he shouted. �You tricked me. I have no use for your dog!� He screamed and dove into the river.
The woman tramped across the bridge to the other side and had a happy reunion with her dog and cow.

The North Star
Among the multitude of stars in the universe, there are a couple that are of great importance to people on Earth. The sun, of course, is one of them. The other is known as Polaris, the North Star. Polaris is special because it is the only star that always appears to be in the same place in the sky. Therefore, Polaris is a great compass. When people in the northern hemisphere of Earth look toward Polaris, they can be certain that they are facing north. The permanence of Polaris in the north sky has helped countless people find their destinations.
Before the invention of modern navigation tools, mariners relied on Polaris. From the top of their hulls, sailors would look for Polaris to figure out their place at sea. They figured out the angle between the star and the horizon to determine their latitude. As long as the equations weren�t erroneous, the results were very reliable. Polaris also let sailors determine North, South, East, and West. By knowing directions and their location, mariners could easily navigate their ships.
To those who sail at night, volatile storms and dark clouds were more than nuisances. They could disrupt entire journeys by blocking the view of Polaris. A captain could err and make an inadvertent wrong turn. The ship could become stranded at sea, and the frantic captain would have no way to improvise to get the ship back on the right course. The mariner�s fears wouldn�t be soothed until the clouds cleared and Polaris came back into view. Even today, sailors sometimes opt to navigate by using Polaris on clear nights.
It�s not difficult to differentiate Polaris from other stars. The Big Dipper, a constellation that is well known in astrology, appears to revolve around Polaris. The handle of the Big Dipper always points to the North Star. When people get lost, it�s comforting to know that their problems can be alleviated by looking at the sky.

The Fossil Hunters
Tim and Dean were great fossil hunters. They were the very best at finding dinosaur bones. Although Tim and Dean were quite similar, they were outright enemies. The two men got into vicious arguments all the time. They couldn�t coexist peacefully because their egos were too large. Tim thought he was the best fossil hunter, while Dean was sure that he was much better than Tim.
One day, Tim was searching for fossils on the periphery of the city when he discovered a huge bone. He had never seen anything like it! He took his shovel and carefully excavated the dirt around it. As he dug, he uncovered more jagged bones. He realized that he had found an entire dinosaur skeleton! Tim couldn�t conceive a plan to remove the huge skeleton all by himself. Such an endeavor would be too arduous. He needed help. He tried to think of people who would be capable of helping him remove the skeleton without breaking it. The only person Tim could think of was Dean, his enemy.
Tim ran into the city to find Dean. Tim found him and said, � Dean, I�ve found the skeletal remains of a huge terrestrial animal. But I can�t get the skeleton out by myself. Will you please help me?
Dean thought that Tim�s claim might be dubious. He replied, � If you�re serious about the skeleton, I�ll help.�
Tim excitedly showed Dean the skeleton�s locale. They worked together to carefully remove each bone. And to keep the bones together, they tied them with elastic strips. When they were finished, they had attained a perfect skeleton. They used plaster to make a mold of the dinosaur�s skull. They engraved their initials into it and gave it to the curator of a local museum.
Tim and Dean found out that they could work very well together. They decided to end their feud and become friends. By combining their talents, the men became even greater than they were before.

Dressed to Excess
If you traveled back in time to the 1700s in Europe, you would laugh when you saw how the aristocracy dressed. Soon you�d realize, though, that the aristocrats of Europe were very serious about their appearance.
The predominant style in women�s attire was enormous dresses. They were often three times larger than the wearer. Ladies even used pads to enlarge the appearance of their hips and shoulders. On the other extreme, the aristocratic women made their waists appear extremely thin. It took several maids stretching fabric and pulling straps in order to get a lady�s waist to the proper thinness. These ladies could barely breathe and often fainted.
Pale skin was also a craze, yet this too was done in excess. One could not simply be pale. Instead, she needed to look as if she had anemia. In order to look paler, ladies actually cut themselves daily, so they would bleed.
The hairstyles, however, were the hallmark of women�s fashion. These stood a meter high on the ladies� heads. The columns of hair were a ridiculous tangle of wigs, jewels, flowers, and even stuffed birds.
Men�s fashion was similarly absurd. Today it would probably seem very feminine. Reputable men wore wigs of long curly hair. Their shoes had large soles or high heels so that they could walk high above the filth on the streets. Furthermore, just like the ladies, the men wore lipstick and put rouge on their cheeks.
Their clothes were brightly colored, often purple and pink. They were made from the finest of fabrics and decorated with jewels and lace. The men vied with one another to see who wore the more expensive clothes, for the clothing signified his wealth and status.
Both men and women spent huge amounts of money and time on how they looked. Though such vanity would seem vulgar today, three hundred years from now, the fashions of our time might also seem completely ridiculous.

The Butler�s Bad Day
The Superintendent of Civic Projects was a busy man. He worked every day of the week and had fancy parties at his house every night.
However, if there was someone busier than him, it was his butler. He worked all day organizing the superintendent�s parties and then cleaned up after them late at night. Hence, while the superintendent slept soundly, snoring loudly in his bed, the butler was still awake.
Sadly, though the butler was always overworked, his profession�s intrinsic nature demanded he never be outspoken. Therefore, his employer never knew the butler hadn�t slept for several days. On any day the butler might make a mistake.
One day, the superintendent said, �This particular party is important. People from the ministry are coming. Everything must be perfect.�
The butler began preparing at once. First he went to the attic to get more chairs and tables. But on his descent, he realized he needed to make the food. A gourmet dinner was necessary for such a party. He boiled water in a kettle for soup and chopped some beef into chunks. Just as he was starting the soup, he remembered that he had to sweep the veranda. As he was sweeping the veranda, he realized that he had to clean the sauna.
By this time, the first guests had arrived. The veranda was still dirty. There were not enough chairs for the guests to sit on, and the soup tasted too pungent. Some guests were dissatisfied. They started to make a fuss, and the party was filled with a din of complaints.
The superintendent�s party was a disaster. He wondered why his butler had made so many mistakes. At last, the butler admitted to being exhausted. His boss felt pity for the butler. He had no idea the butler was so tired. He said, �You should have told me earlier, then we could have avoided this whole ordeal.�

A Bet
Russell finished running a relay and joined his friend Becky in the cafeteria. He asked, �What�s for lunch?�
�Sesame chicken. It�s OK, except the meat�s charred. Oh, and watch out for the chili peppers,� Becky said.
�Chilies don�t bother me!� said Russell.
� My stepmother says you should be careful with them,� replied Becky.
An argument ensued about eating chilies. �Chilies aren�t so bad. I bet I can take more bites of this chili than you,� Russell said.
Becky was wary of eating the pepper. Despite her reluctance, she didn�t want to say no to the bet. She wavered about whether to do it or not. She negotiated the details. �What will the winner get?� she asked.
�The loser has to carry the winner�s books for a year! I�ll even let you go first.�
Becky replied, � Fine, but to clarify, you�ll carry my books for the entire school year, right?�
Russell restated the agreement, �That�s right I�ll carry your books all year if you win�which you won�t!�
His dogged persuasion convinced her. The chili looked benign, but Becky knew it could cause a lot of pain. She bit the bottom of the pepper. Surprisingly, she felt nothing.
� My turn,� said Russell. He bit the middle of the chili. Immediately, he seemed to be in distress. He gasped and his face alternated between brave and pained expressions. He experienced an overdose of spice. He was on the verge of tears and finally let out a horrible cry.
�Take this,� said Becky, handing him her drink.
�That was awful!� he said, continuing to sip from the glass.
That night, Becky researched chilies. The next day she said in an apologetic voice, � I read that the hot part of chilies is in the middle, where the seeds are. I�m sorry�I feel like I cheated by going first.�
Russell was relieved, not only did he learn something new about chilies, but he learned that Becky was a good friend.

Amazing Komodo Dragons
Once, a British gazette had an unusual story. Scientists at a zoo made a discovery about komodo dragons. Komodo dragons are giant lizards that grow up to two and a half meters long. A female lizard at the zoo had babies. However, it had never been around a male lizard in its entire life. After the scientists publicized their discovery, many people thought it was fictitious.
But it was true. It was discovered that female komodo dragons can have babies without the help of their male counterparts. This contradicts what scientists know about how most animals have babies.
In most cases, there are many things that can obstruct this type of reproduction. For example, adult males and females carry different genes needed to make an embryo. If the genes are homogeneous, the babies are weaker and have genetic problems. Over time, the weakened species dies out completely. This makes it necessary for the male to be involved. However, scientists verified that when Komodo babies are born, their genes aren�t the exact same genes as their mother. Also, they are devoid of any genetic problems.
Scientists theorize that Komodo dragons developed the ability because it helps the species fend off extinction. If a volcano erupts, lava can kill all of the komodo dragons on an island. However, as long as one female eludes death, she can prolong the survival of the species. Luckily, Komodo dragons are vigorous swimmers. So the surviving female can plunge into the ocean and swim to another island. When she comes ashore, she can reproduce by herself. Over time, the genes within the population diverge. Then, the sparse population increases. Once again there is a surplus of lizards on one island. Scientists think that this may be how the lizards took over all of the islands in that area.

Greek Magical Papyri
The Greek Magical Papyri is a collection of writing about magic. After it was found in the Egyptian desert, it took experts years to decipher it. The text was written in at least three different ancient languages. After many years, experts realized it contained a number of spells that varied greatly in scope.
The most common types of magic in the collection dealt with healing illnesses like pneumonia. Some spells also gave advice for treating people with mental illnesses, such as those who became psychotic. Some spells asked for unusual things, like crocodile dung. But botany was an important part of the magic. Many healing spells gave instructions on how to use herbs and plants that were believed to be therapeutic. For example, in order to cure arthritis, the book says that the magician should build an ornate altar. Then he should mash different types of herbs and place them on top of it. At dusk, he is supposed to say a spell, so the gods would be gratified.
Other parts of the collection describe how to hone one�s psychic abilities and how to give credible descriptions of the future. Often, the book advised people how to use different objects to tell the future, including tea leaves. Also, one part of the book tells what different dreams might mean. It gives advice for using dreams to tell the future.
A small part of the book, however, is more sinister than the rest. It is meant to cause strife and deception. For example, one tells how to give someone warts, while another will make all of the victim�s farm animals die. However, if someone�s farm animals died as a result of a curse, he could ask a magician to perform magic that makes the deceased come back to life.

When he boarded, the ship was congested with people. As Kevin walked to his cabin, he saw the exclusive first-class section. Everybody inside was wearing fancy garments. He would have liked to socialize with the people inside, but it was against proper etiquette. People paid a premium for the privilege to ride in first-class.
Instead, he went to his cabin next to the freight section of the boat. His room smelled bad, and the floorboards were warped and deformed in some areas. He could also hear the motor humming as it waited to propel the ship forward. Suddenly, Kevin was unsettled by something, but he wasn�t sure why.

Dangerous Bites
There are many animals with dangerous bites in the world, but which one is the worst? Some would say that the elusive short-tailed mamushi has the worst bite. The snake only goes into homes to chase pests such as mice. Otherwise, it stays in the fields, where it�s dangerous to people who forage for food there. If someone stuns it by accidentally stepping on it, it bites to protect itself. At first, the effects of the bite may seem negligible because it doesn�t cause a lot of bleeding. However, after a few moments, the venom induces paralysis in the area where the individual was bitten. Furthermore, the venom can also impede respiration. If the person doesn�t go to the doctor, they are susceptible to kidney deterioration.

Others would argue that tigers have the worst bite. Mother tigers are inseparable from their babies and seem to be the gentlest creatures when they are around their young. However, if the babies are threatened, the mother tiger�s savage nature prevails. With strong jaws and the ability to move quickly, the tiger can kill someone with one bite. That�s because it always tries to bite an important artery when it attacks. If the artery is ruptured, the victim will bleed to death.

In the mainstream, animal bites are seen as the most dangerous. But some scientists think this idea is invalid. In fact, the most dangerous bite might be the human bite. When scientists magnified the contents in human saliva, they found about three hundred different microbes in it. A human bite can be dangerous if the bacteria enters the body through a cut, which can make people very sick. Furthermore, most people don�t realize how serious a man bit can be, so they don't go to the doctor right away. This gives the wound a chance to get infected and cause more problems.

The Avalanche
Randy was a forest ranger. Because of his job, he was secluded in a cabin in the wilderness.
One day, the radio reported, �Convection in the atmosphere is causing a lot of clouds to form. A serious storm ...� Suddenly, the radio went silent. The signal was lost.
He went outside and looked at the overcast sky. Anybody else would have taken the dark sky as an omen of a very bad storm, but not Randy. His upbringing had taught him consistency. He had done this job for years, and nothing could stop him. Besides, he thought nothing could hurt him.
Today, he had a very important task to do. The snow was starting to pile up high on the mountain. If too much accumulated, it could cause an avalanche. But Randy had an apparatus to get rid of the snow. It used dynamite to shake the snow and make the top * layer of snow come down.
As the snow started falling, he thought about returning to the office until the storm stopped, but he decided not to. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise behind him. It was an avalanche! He started to run, but within seconds, he was knocked sideways and buried by the snow and rubble from an old cabin that had been destroyed. An aerial rescue team came quickly. Randy was just a speck amongst the great pile of snow, but the team found him thanks to his brightly colored jacket. They quickly took him to a hospital.
After a few hours, Randy woke up in the hospital. He looked at the sober faces of the doctors and saw his wife sobbing.
�What�s wrong?� he asked. He didn�t remember what had happened.
�You were almost killed!� his wife said.
�You broke several ribs. But the rest of you is still reasonably intact. You are really lucky to be alive,� the doctor said.
After five days, Randy was discharged from the hospital. The experience had taught him a poignant lesson: he was a mortal, and nature was much more powerful than him.

King Croesus was once one of the richest kings in the world. He ruled over Lydia, an ancient empire located near modern-day Turkey and controlled a valuable commodity: gold. Many people were very envious of him.
One day, a messenger disclosed some interesting news: political unrest in Persia had weakened the empire. Before then, the Persians had taken over many countries. Many leaders were scared of the Persian conquest. But King Croesus understood the dynamics of war better than most. He decided that it would be a good time to try to beat the Persians while they were weak.
He advocated starting war, but nobody shared his sentiment. Then he asked a wise member of the senate who was visiting from Athens. The sage didn�t say whether he should attack the Persians or not. He only warned him that his good luck wouldn�t last.
Finally, King Croesus sent a messenger to visit the Oracle, a special lady who could see % the future. The messenger gave the Oracle jugs of wine and baskets of lentils in order to make her happy.
When the messenger came back, he was in a festive mood.
�What was the Oracle�s prophecy?� asked King Croesus.
The jolly messenger responded, �She said that if you attack Persia, you will destroy a great empire.�
The news filled Croesus with euphoria. After hearing the Oracle�s prophecy, many civilians enrolled in the Lydian army. The king marshaled his troops and prepared them for a war with Persia. Their morale was high because they were sure they would win. Soon, King Croesus authorized an attack against the Persians.
However, the Persian army was still very strong. After a few months of fighting, it was obvious that the Oracle�s prophecy had come true: by attacking the Persians, King Croesus had destroyed a great empire�his own! King Croesus should have considered the advice more carefully.

The Butler
Greta was an elderly lady who lived alone in a huge, dilapidated mansion. The mansion was in terrible condition. It was covered with filth, and most of the furniture was broken. Plus, the kitchen sink leaked water all over the floor. Greta was too old to do housekeeping and repairs herself, so she hired a butler named Gordon.
Gordon was a young, muscular man. His muscles were a testament to his strong work ethic. He believed that if he worked hard, great things would happen for him. On his first day, he worked for hours cleaning and making repairs. He swept up mounds of dirt. He tightened the valve underneath the kitchen faucet to stop the leak. He even bought timber to build new stools for the kitchen. He worked so hard that his fingers went numb, and he got cramps in his shoulders.
Gordon worked hard every day. Even when tasks were boring, he was never reckless. He made sure there were no flaws in his work. Gordon was worried, however, that Greta wasn�t pleased. She never expressed thanks or said that he did a good job. The lack of appreciation evoked unhappy feelings in Gordon. He even thought about quitting. But he decided the right thing to do was to keep working hard.
One day, while Gordon was sweeping, Greta said, �Gordon! I have a surprise for you!� He went to Greta�s room and saw a beautiful slate statue. It looked just like him! It was adorned with a banner that read: �Welcome home.�
Greta said, �You�ve made this ugly old mansion look new again. I�m so thankful for your hard work that I want you to have it. I�ll move into a smaller house.�
He grinned and gave Greta a big hug. He said, � I�m in bliss! My hard work really paid off!�
The two said their farewells, and Gordon spent the afternoon admiring his beautiful new home.

The End of Smallpox
Smallpox was once the most deadly disease in the world. During the 1800s, more than 20 million people got the disease every year. Of those, nearly half died. At the onset of smallpox, people suffered from high fevers, headaches, vomiting, and aching muscles. Yet the worst symptom of all was an intolerable rash that caused irritation on the entire body. Those who survived the disease were often rendered blind or left with gross scars on their face and body.
Today, however, cases of smallpox are very rare due to the work of many countries during the late 1900s. This federation of countries collaborated to completely destroy smallpox. Early in the century, wealthy countries in Europe and North America had developed a substance that made the body immune to smallpox. They had required all their citizens to get this vaccine to counteract the disease. Hence, the people of these countries no longer had to worry about smallpox.
However, many of the needy people in poorer parts of the world still suffered from the disease. Their countries could not afford the vaccine nor supply enough doctors to curb the spread of smallpox.
In 1950, the wealthier countries of the world vowed to free the world of the disease. They pledged to supply the vaccine to any country that could not afford it. Scientists compiled lists of areas where the disease still thrived. Then doctors diagnosed people who had the disease in these areas. They enacted laws that prohibited people with smallpox from mixing with those who did not. In this way, they could not transmit the disease to others. Then the doctors gave all of them the vaccine.
It took a longtime and a lot of work. But nearly thirty years later, on December 9,1979, a group of scientists certified that smallpox had been successfully stopped. The humane efforts of people from all over the world had accomplished a great task.

The Coward�s Lesson
Tom was easily frightened. He enlisted in the army because he thought the military would teach him courage. And though he needed courage, he never imagined how he would learn it.
During a march across a tract of wilderness near his country�s frontier, Tom strayed from his squad. He had stopped to gaze at a splendid view of a lush valley. When he turned around, his squad was gone. He searched for them, but because their outfits had camouflage, he couldn�t find them.
It was getting dark, and Tom grew weary. All he had was a knife, a boomerang, and his handbook. He made a camp for the night. It was cold, and the ground was hard. He wished he had his cot and a blanket. Instead, he made a fire, wrapped himself tightly in his jacket, and fell asleep.
A loud noise roused him from his sleep. �What was that?� he wondered.
Then he noticed it. An animal of substantial size had left a print from its paw in the dirt. He sat closer to the fire and looked into the darkness. He imagined a large beast jumping from the gloom and attacking him. He shook so much from fear that it felt like the marrow in his bones quivered.
Tom contemplated many different plans. He was hesitant to act. He decided to stay by the fire, but during his vigil, he heard more noises.
He couldn�t contend with his fear any longer. He knew what he had to do. He made a torch and followed the prints. He heard a twig snap very close ahead, but he bravely went on. Seconds later, he discovered what had scared him. It was only a kangaroo.
Tom went back to his camp and slept. In the morning, he found his squad. He had finally learned courage. He learned that he had to confront his fear in order to conquer it.

Epidemic in Zimbabwe
In August of 2008, a deadly cholera epidemic manifested in Zimbabwe. A severe health hazard caused the outbreak. There was an extreme lack of clean drinking water in the overcrowded urban cities. Garbage and chemicals got into the public water supplies and contaminated them. Since people did not have access to other sources, they had to drink the dirty water.
The outbreak spread rapidly and infected almost 16,000 people. The illness caused extreme pain in people�s intestines. It also caused a deficiency of important fluids in sick people�s bodies. Without the proper fluids and minerals, metabolic processes stopped working correctly. People were unable to digest food properly or replenish their lost nutrients. If they had not received viable treatment, they would have been likely to die. It was imperative for help to come soon.
However, the government of Zimbabwe was unable to provide help to its people. The government didn�t have a plan to stop the spread of cholera. In addition, the country was too poor to get clean water or medication for the sick. The people seemed to be doomed.
Luckily, many other countries recognized the paramount need to contain the outbreak. Dozens of voluntary practitioners from Britain, France, the United States, and other countries went to Zimbabwe to treat the disease. Through the provision of sterile drinking water and medication, people finally got the treatment they badly needed. The compassionate doctors were able to save the lives of thousands. By January of 2009, the epidemic was almost completely contained.
Today, the Zimbabwean government is working with other countries to prevent future epidemics. They are cleaning up the water supply and learning how to avoid health hazards. The system used to filter water is being upgraded. The government now administers the water supply plants and makes sure that they adhere to strict safety guidelines. Hopefully, future instances of cholera will be treated before they start deadly epidemics.

Hundreds of people had come to see a popular satire, but during the performance a fire started in the theater. The audience and actors evacuated the building. Luckily, no one was hurt, and the fire was soon put out. Immediately, the audience assembled into an angry mob and demanded to know what had happened.
It was soon revealed that the fire had started backstage, and only two people were in the area at the time. One was the husband of the play�s star actress, the billionaire Henry Rich. The other was the theater�s janitor, Bill, a large and strong man who looked like a brute.
The crowd segregated the two men and demanded to know who the culprit was. Most of the crowd thought that Bill was to blame. They felt that he had started the fire without ever subjecting him to any scrutiny. Bill resented this but said nothing.
Luckily, the billionaire�s wife testified in his defense. �Your decision is premature,� she told the crowd. � I fell down amid the tumult while everyone fled the fire. Bill rescued me and carried me out of the building. I think you underestimate his character. Besides, in order to be close enough to save me, he couldn�t have been near the place where the fire began.�
The crowd then turned their eyes to the billionaire. � He did it!� they shouted. �Make him pay!�
�Wait,� the billionaire said over the uproar. � I admit that I started the fire, but it was an accident. I was going backstage to see my wife and was clumsy. I collided with a lamp, and it fell to the floor. The floor was flammable. A fire started, and I fled.�
The mob was surprised. The man they blamed was innocent, and the billionaire was guilty. To pay for his error, the billionaire not only repaired the theater but had it remade to be better than before.

The Tenacious Inventor
A young student of meteorology was having a difficult time with an experiment. He was attempting to duplicate lightning in clouds. He had made a device that could simulate lightning. It worked by releasing an electromagnetic pulse into the cloud. This pulse, in turn, stimulated the electrons in the cloud�s particles. Then the electrons produced lightning.
But his meteorological experiment had a major defect. He couldn�t get the device into the sky.
He had tied it to balloons, but they had burst. He had shot the device from a cannon, but the force of the cannon had damaged it.
�You should give up,� his friends told him. �You�ll never get that thing into the air.�
But his friends� criticisms only spurred him to try again. The student was very innovative, and at last, he thought that he had an innovation that would work. He attached wings to the device, and on one dreary day, when clouds blocked the light of the sun, he started his experiment anew.
He placed the device on a rocket and launched it into the sky. The propulsion of the rocket carried the device high into the air. The rocket accelerated into the clouds and then released the device. It glided on its wings through the clouds, and when it penetrated the center of a large black cloud, it emitted the electromagnetic pulse. And just as he had predicted, lightning shot from the cloud!
He called his professors, and the next day they came to watch. He successfully duplicated the experiment. His teachers were extremely impressed and called the student and his invention ingenious.
The student was given many awards and became a famous inventor. He had not given up. He had remained tenacious and succeeded.

The Nurse�s Lesson
One of the children in the nursery was sick. The child�s mother, who was usually quite vivacious and chattered constantly, was quiet and worried. She knew that if she did not act quickly, the child�s condition would deteriorate.
She summoned the children�s nurse and said to her, �The monks make a medicine that can cure my child�s sickness. Please, hurry tonight to the monastery and get it.�
The nurse immediately hurried from the manor to get the medicine. The monastery was far away by Rabbit Cove, and there was no freeway leading to it. The only way there was to walk along a dark and winding trail.
The temperature was close to zero degrees centigrade, and it was raining. Luckily, the nurse had grabbed her raincoat beforehand. She zipped it up and pulled the hood over her head.
� I�ll never make it there,� she thought. � Perhaps I should return and go in the morning.� But she remembered the sick child and decided to continue.
Finally, she arrived at the monastery. It was very late. She feared the monks would not be hospitable. But she approached the door and knocked anyway. The rain had condensed on the exterior of the windows by the door. All she could see was the profile of a large man coming to answer the door. Again, she was filled with fear.
But the monk smiled at her when he opened the door. He took her outstretched hand and welcomed her with a hearty voice. The place was warm, and she heard a concerto playing in another room. She relaxed.
� How can I help you?� the monk asked, and the nurse explained the situation.
He instantly knew what to do. He grabbed a parcel of medicine and took her back to the manor in a carriage. The medicine worked. The nurse was happy she had persevered through the bad weather and found the monastery. Now the boy would be able to live a long natural life.

Seizures Then and Now
If a person who lived 200 years ago was treated for a seizure today, they would be surprised by the treatment�s novelty. That�s because doctors in the 1800s were influenced more by primal medical beliefs than science.
Rather than thinking the brain caused seizures, people in the 180' still thought they were the result of strange forces. They equated seizures with the work of evil spirits. Others felt that the seizures had a cosmic or lunar cause. They believed that the cycles of the moon and constellations could make someone have a seizure.
During a session to treat a patient who had seizures, doctors would force the patient to invoke the grace of the Almighty. They thought if the patient did this, then the patient would rid themselves of the evil spirits causing the seizures.
The advent of modern psychiatry occurred during the 1800s. At that time people who suffered from seizures were placed in psychiatric hospitals. They were treated like they were insane. However, none of the outmoded treatments worked.
It wasn�t until the late 1850s that the causes of seizures were understood. We know today that these causes pertain to the brain. Misfired signals from the brain cause a jerking reflex in the body. These usually occur when someone is very tired.
Once the causes of seizures were known, definitive treatments were developed. Today, treatments range from taking pills to having surgery. Treatment is personalized according to the type of seizure the patient has.
Even today, some people are unsure about seizures. Their most common mistake is thinking that a person having a seizure will swallow their tongue. They often shove some utensil in the person�s mouth. However, this doesn�t help. The utensil often blocks the airway and prevents the person from inhaling. Yet most of the public no longer fear people who have seizures. Instead, they can now help and comfort a person if they have a seizure.

The Greedy Bee
A young bee had passed his intermediate level exams. He now knew everything about flowers. He understood how they used photosynthesis to make oxygen and which ones produced the best pollen. Bees had an important dependency on pollen. From the beginning of time, bees� eternal task was to gather pollen and make honey with it.
Since he passed his exams, the little bee had earned his inclusion in the swarms that gathered pollen. He was excited because he was finally allowed to leave the hive. He left with the next swarm and was determined to find the perfect flower. Soon he saw a large, vibrant flower full of pollen. He landed on a petal and walked toward the pollen at the flower�s center.
Immediately, he began rolling in the pollen, gathering it on his legs and wings. The fine texture of the pollen tickled when it stuck to his body. It was the best experience the little bee had ever had. He gathered as much as he could.
But when he was flying back home, he realized that all the pollen had an adverse effect. He had no control over his flight. The intermittent wind fluctuated in power. He was blown to and fro. One minute he was flying straight, and the next minute the wind had reversed his course.
He tried to dump some of the pollen, but it acted as an adhesive. He couldn�t get it off. He became tired and fell to the ground.
�What am I going to do now?� he thought. Just then, his mentor landed next to him and began cleaning the excess pollen off the little bee. �You shouldn�t have taken so much,� his mentor said.
Finally, with the pollen off of him, the bee easily regained his strength, and like a phoenix, the young bee flew back into the air. When he returned to the hive, he turned to his mentor and said, � I learned an important lesson today. I will never be greedy again.�

The Mayor of Sherman
The cosmopolitan city of Sherman needed to elect a new mayor. Two men aspired to become mayor: Mr. Jones and Mr. Webb. Mr. Jones was a tall, handsome man. He was a phenomenal speaker, and the citizens loved him. However, Mr. Jones didn�t know much about running a city. He was a pathological liar who merely flattered people with his words. Mr. Webb was very different. He was a small, unattractive man. He was lame and limped when he walked. But he was an expert on politics and knew what was best for the people.
The citizens of Sherman didn�t care about what the politicians had to say. No one listened to Mr. Webb, even though he had great ideas. They cheered when Mr. Jones spoke, although he didn�t talk about important things. His pretty words put people in a trance. All the polls predicted that Mr. Jones would win the election.
When the votes were totaled, Mr. Jones won easily. But when he took office, he didn�t know what to do! He tried to hide his ignorance by working in secrecy. He added a law to the city�s constitution that prevented citizens from seeing the mayor. He even censored newspapers that tried to disseminate information about his inability to help the people.
Soon, however, Mr. Jones became infamous for his poor leadership. There was an outburst of anger among the citizens. They were full of remorse for their misguided decision to elect an ignorant mayor. They voted to remove Mr. Jones and let Mr. Webb take over. Immediately, Mr. Webb proved that he was a great mayor. He abolished Mr. Jones�s law, and he was willing to talk openly with everyone. He tackled important issues and amended unfair laws in the city�s charter.
The citizens learned that a pleasant appearance and nice words do not make a good leader. The most important qualities are intelligence and a desire to help others.

The Editor�s Choice
A newspaper editor sat at his desk and stared at the flashing cursor on his computer�s screen. He didn�t know if he should delete the article he had just written or go ahead and publish it. He was scared and filled with doubt.
The empire had passed a new law stating that citizens could only use the imperial language. The editor disagreed with the law and decided to write an article about why it was wrong. He felt that the new law excluded people of different nationalities and racial and ethnic backgrounds. He had firsthand knowledge of what it feels like not to be fluent in the imperial language because he was from a remote part of the empire.
He felt that the empire shouldn�t be monolingual and should be more inclusive. Yet he was afraid that he would get in trouble for having this belief. Many would say that he was not a patriot�that he didn�t love the empire. But he didn�t wish to undermine the authority of the empire. He wanted to argue that the empire could be stronger if it accepted people of various cultures and beliefs.
At last, he decided to stop being a coward and to be earnest about how he felt. He wrote the article. It wasn�t rude or angry, but rather, very solemn and intelligent. The next day it was published in all the papers.
Everyone was impressed by his tact and showed solidarity with his ideas. He expected to be arrested any day, but the police never came. Surprisingly, instead of being prosecuted, he became a hero. The legislature changed the law, and people from many linguistic backgrounds praised him.
"Never be afraid to be vocal," the editor later wrote. "If you think something is wrong, then stand up for what you believe."

The Ice House
Last year, Erik constructed one of the world�s strangest houses in the glacial landscape of northern Sweden. He called it the Ice House: a house made entirely of ice and snow. All of the beds, chairs, tables, and walls are cold, hard sculptures of ice.
A group of architects and volunteers from all over the world traveled to the site of the Ice House and began its construction. The multicultural group journeyed through blizzards and frigid temperatures to reach the site. Once the builders arrived, there was an interchange of ideas, and tools were allocated to each worker. An expert was selected to oversee the building process to make sure there was no discord between the workers. Once a plan was generated, they got right to work. The design was very unique; the builders couldn�t replicate the design from normal houses.
The first step was to build the walls and ceiling. The builders used a metal frame to help them build the structure. After the ice was in place, the frame was removed. The builders then created furniture and art pieces. Designs were carved into each piece. One worker carved big wavy lines, and another made tiny clockwise, concentric circles. Finally, the workers carved small cavities in the roof and inserted colored lights. When the work was finished, the beautiful house was ready for a resident to enjoy.
Living in the Ice House is an experience like no other. Erik stores his belongings in an ice locker and lays out a sleeping bag on his ice bed. At dinner, he dines on a delicious salad with crisp toppings. And for the main course, he enjoys appetizing fish caught from a nearby river. The fish are pierced with icicles and served on ice plates. After dinner, he gets ready for a cold night. The omission of heaters can be too much for his visitors sometimes. Luckily, there are warm rooms nearby, as a courtesy to people who get too cold.

Preparing of the Future
Overpopulation is a big problem in the world today. Too many people are crammed into cities and towns around the globe. Earth�s population is about 6.5 billion people. This number is growing every day. In just 50 years, the population will be almost 9 billion.
Many people worry that the Earth won�t have enough resources to support so many people. One major reason for this is that wasting resources and polluting have become habitual behaviors. Industrial output results in polluting the air with dangerous fumes. Also, cars and machines waste a ton of important natural resources like oil and water. It�s possible that the Earth may become so damaged that it cannot support a large population of humans.
Another issue is the lack of useful land for cultivating crops. Even today, many people subsist on mere scraps of food and little water. In 50 years, many experts worry that huge numbers of people will starve to death. So what is being done to prepare for the future?
People are realizing they can no longer justify their wasteful behavior or defer action to fix it. Many car companies already have patents on prototypes for very efficient cars. Such cars waste no resources and produce no pollution. A conversion to clean cars means that petroleum can be saved for the future. In addition, the environmental sectors of many governments are setting strict rules for industries that pollute too much. If companies do not abide by the standards, they are penalized with higher taxes. In some cases, their operations might be suspended altogether.
Food is also an issue that is being tackled. Many countries are now subscribing to the point of view that immediate action is needed. They are determining ways to export goods to people in need, so that no one goes hungry. Experts will continue to come up with ideas for the future, and a synthesis of these ideas will help to support the growing population.

Hundred Plays
Over two thousand years ago, Chinese farmers had a problem. Even though they were very industrious, the weather became too cold outside to plant their staple food, rice. So what did they do? Since they had so much free time during the long, cold winters, the inventive farmers started performing tricks to entertain themselves. They used their farm tools and anything they could find to make their tricks more spectacular. They even twisted their bodies into crazy shapes and performed awesome jumps. Overtime, they became great acrobats, and their art form came to be known as � Hundred Plays.�
Hundred Plays involves doing many kinds of tricks. For example, in Mandarin-speaking parts of China, performers do the lion dance. They wear costumes and mimic the animal�s movements. Early performers also did tricks on ropes and vines that were high above the ground.
Even though the acrobats� fluid movements may have looked easy, they took a lot of work.
Learning Hundred Plays is a communal event. A veteran of the acrobatic arts usually teaches younger people in the village. They spend a lot of time rehearsing. The young performers also learn an old philosophy. The teachings help them harmonize the sensory aspects of acrobatics with mental aspects. In other words, it teaches them to use their physical and mental strength together.
Since the art has its origins with poor farmers, rich people used to scorn acrobats. They thought acrobats were villains. The rich people thought the acrobats just wanted to trick them. But later, their misguided opinions changed. Acrobats came to be respected in Chinese society. They were invited to perform in metropolitan areas as well as in small villages. They performed for important people, including judicial officers. Arts advocacy groups convinced the government to support Chinese acrobatics. As a result, there is now a statute that made several villages the center of training future acrobats.

The Kidnapping
Anne was a very quiet girl who had an inherent fear of almost everything. The kids at school would play tricks on her all the time. They would hide behind the door of the school janitor�s closet, then jump out to scare her. Once, a boy dressed up like a vampire and chased her down the street. Anne hated being constrained by her fears, but she didn�t know how to be brave.
She was walking home from school one day when someone came up behind her. Before she could turn around, a powerful man grabbed her. She couldn�t scream because a huge hand was put over her mouth. Anne knew that this could not be another stunt by her classmates. The scary man restrained her arms and legs and carried her to his house. He tied Anne to a chair. Her guts began to hurt because she was so scared.
The man prodded Anne with his forefinger and said, �You�ll stay right here until I get a ransom from your parents. Then I�ll be rich!� The dirty man spit when he talked. A string of saliva hung from his moist lips. Anne was terrified and intimidated by the horrible man. But she knew she had to escape somehow.
Eventually, the man yawned. Anne waited quietly until he fell asleep. As he slept, she carefully wiggled her arms and legs until the ropes became loose. She slipped out of the ropes and carefully opened the door. She sprinted to the bus depot and boarded a bus to the police station. She told the police what happened, and they arrested the kidnapper.
The kids at school were amazed. They asked her, �Weren�t you too scared to escape?�
She said, �Nope, I knew that I had to be brave and get out of there!�
The kids were very tolerant of Anne from then on. They even decided that they would emulate her bravery if they ever got into a tough situation.

The Earl of Shining
In the village of Hampton, there was an old soldier named Michael, but he was known to the world as the Earl of Shining. Michael was once an expert archer and a great fighter. In fact, his skills seemed to be hereditary; all the people in his ancestry were famous warriors. However, he was getting old and no longer wished to fight.
One day, he was in the forest hunting prey when he saw a beautiful prophet singing a hymn. She said, �Michael, an evil army is involved in a conspiracy to take over Hampton. You�re the only one who can defeat them and stop the tyranny. The village needs you!�
Michael replied, � But I�m too old to fight! I�m not confident that I can do it.�
The prophet said, �You must try. I will even make a potion to increase your strength.�
The prophet took out a bottle and a funnel. She poured some vinegar and garlic into the bottle. Next, she added some seasoning and sodium and shook it up.
Michael smelled the potion. �Wow, this is fragrant,� he said in a sarcastic tone. He inverted the bottle and drank the whole potion. He immediately felt stronger. � I�ll try my best,� he promised.
Michael rode his horse to a hilltop, where he could see the village of Hampton below. He saw the evil tyrant and his men marching in a procession through the town.
Michael charged down the hill and into the village. An enemy deputy officer shouted, � He looks as strong as an ox!� It was an apt analogy. Michael grabbed the officer and threw him across the street with one arm. The rest of the officers screamed and rode away, and their army followed.
The prophet reappeared. Michael said, � It�s a good thing you gave me the potion.�
She replied, � But Michael, the potion was fake! Your strength really came from having confidence!
Michael realized he really was still great. He just needed to believe in himself.

The Lord and the Farmers
A wealthy lord was renovating his mansion. He had added another story to his home with large windows that overlooked the farmers� pastures on the eastern border of his land. Around the mansion, he then erected a great wall. He built an arch for the gate out of huge slabs of stone. The lord was overjoyed with the addition to his home.
However, one day while he was sitting on the terrace, some farmers knocked at his door. He invited them in. Despite his hospitality, the farmers appeared to be in a foul mood.
�Why are you so upset?� the lord asked.
One farmer replied, �That is actually the reason for our visit.� He then handed the lord a petition. It alleged that the shadow cast by the mansion was harming their pastures. �Your mansion now casts a shadow over several hectares of our land,� the farmer explained. �The turf in the shadow has died, and our cattle now have less grass to eat.�
� It is too late for me to revise my plans,� the lord answered. �You will just have to live with the change.�
His reply only heightened the farmers� anger. They left, but they assembled that night outside the mansion�s gate. They planned to destroy the mansion. The lord�s servants tried to defend the house, but the farmers outnumbered them.
The servants fled, and the farmers rushed into the mansion and set it on fire. Everyone got out of the house, and there were no casualties. However, the fire soon spread from the house to the adjoining pastures that belonged to the farmers.
Both sides� properties were destroyed. The lord and the farmers were sorry for their actions. The lord promised to pay for the burned pastures, and the farmers promised to rebuild the mansion. They had learned that when you fight, both sides lose.

The Shortcut
A truck driver was driving cargo from the outback to the coast. His load was comprised of many types of ore. He needed a huge truck to carry its bulk to a ship waiting at a pier on the country�s eastern coast. At the border between two counties, he�d have to pay a tariff on the cargo. However, he could keep his money if he avoided the station at the border. He worried about getting in trouble for not paying the tariff, but the thought of extra money outweighed this concern.
He took out his road map. To his surprise, it depicted a small road that had a dual advantage. It not only avoided the border station but also was a shorter route to the coast. He decided to take the shortcut.
However, along his journey, he soon ran into problems. First, he had to cross a small wooden bridge. His truck weighed too much for the bridge. It was analogous to an elephant trying to stand on a tree branch. The bridge started to break as the truck crossed, and the trailer tilted to the right. Fortunately, the truck made it safely across, but most of the ore fell into the river below.
Next, it was a very hot day. The thermometer read over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The truck�s engine became too hot, so the driver parked it in the shade of a grove of trees until it cooled down.
Later, he took a wrong turn. He stopped and took out his binoculars. He scanned his surroundings and eventually discovered a landmark that led him back to the proper route.
Finally, he arrived at the pier, but the ship wasn�t there. When he asked about the ship�s whereabouts, a man said that it had left thirty minutes ago. He had not fulfilled his duty. He realized then the paradox of the shortcut. The shortest route can be the longest, and vice versa, a long route may be the fastest.

The Mad Hatter
One morning, Lucas sat outside with his grandfather. They looked past the gravel road that led to a natural reservoir on the delta. On the other side of the water, there was a cottage.
� Does a ghost live there?� Lucas asked.
� No, a mad hatter lives there,� said his grandfather. Lucas didn�t know what a mad hatter was, but the image of a scary man haunted him.
Later, Lucas went for a walk in the forest. He collected pieces of amber and granite that he found on the ground. He looked at the moss on the trees and watched a bird peck at the ground. But the forest was like a maze. Soon, Lucas was lost.
Lucas heard somebody behind him. He wanted to run away, but he fell. He had a streak of blood on his shirt and some pebbles stuck in his skin. Then a man appeared.
� I will take you home. First, let�s get you cleaned up,� he said.
Lucas followed him. When they arrived at the cottage, he realized the man was the mad hatter!
He sat down inside. It smelled like charcoal, but it looked like a normal house. The man brought Lucas back some medicine.
� It�s a bit old, but it�s not expired,� the man said.
While Lucas cleaned his cut, the man washed the blood out of his shirt with detergent.
Lucas asked, �Are you a mad hatter?�
The man laughed and replied, �That�s a euphemism for a crazy person. Actually, I�m pretty normal. I�m a columnist fora newspaper,� said the man. He pointed to his credentials which hung on the wall.
Lucas could hear the crickets outside. It was getting dark, so he asked, �Could you take me home now?�
The man said yes. Lucas was surprised that people thought the man was crazy. He was actually very courteous. Maybe Lucas should have a more liberal attitude. Next time, Lucas wouldn�t make judgments about people without getting to know them first.
